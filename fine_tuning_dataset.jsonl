{"prompt": "Explain this concept from the video 4Cr0OxXU7jY: [Music]\nlet me ask you a question are you\nintrigued by the complexity of the tech\nworld\nwell at the roots of this tech world the\ntwo components that constitute every\ntechnology are software and hardware and\nthese require vigorous development\nthrough a tested and approved cycle of\nprocesses hello everyone and welcome to\nthis video by intellipaat in this video\ni will discuss the software development\nlifecycle but before we begin please\nmake sure to subscribe to our channel\nand hit that bell icon for regular\nupdates now let's take a look at the\nagenda firstly we will see what is meant\nby software then we will see what is\nsdlc then the need of sdlc then we'll\nmove on to the steps involved that is we\nwill discuss the sdlc life cycle and the\nphases then we'll see what models can be\nused for sdlc and lastly a conclusion\nnow let's see our first agenda that is\nwhat is meant by software\nsoftware is a collection of instructions\ndata or computer programs that are used\nto run machines and carry out particular\nactivities it is the antithesis of\nhardware which refers to a computer\nexternal components a device's running\nprograms scripts and applications are\ncollectively referred to as software in\nthis context next we'll see what is sdlc\nwell sdlc stands for software\ndevelopment lifecycle it outlines the\nnumerous steps needed in creating\nsoftware to produce a high quality end\nproduct the stages of the sdlc encompass\nthe entire life cycle of a piece of\nsoftware from conception to retirement\nfollowing the sdlc process results in\nthe software being developed in a\ncontrolled manner next we'll see the\nneed of sdlc the development team must\nchoose a lifecycle model that is\nappropriate for a specific strategy and\nthen adhere to it the creation of a\nsoftware product would not be systematic\nand disciplined without the use of a\nprecise life cycle model there needs to\nbe agreement among team members\nregarding when and what to do when\nproducing a software product if not it\nwould be an indication of disorder and\nproject failure the criteria for\nentering and leaving each phase are\ndescribed in a software lifecycle model\nonly if the stage energy requirements\nhave been met can a phase start\ntherefore it is impossible to detect the\nentry and exit criteria for a stage\nwithout a software lifecycle model it\nbecomes difficult for software project\nmanagers to keep track of the project's\ndevelopment without software lifecycle\nmodels now let's take a look at the\ndevelopment steps involved firstly we\nhave planning and requirement analysis\nthen we have specifying the needs\nfollowing which we have creating or\ndesigning the software then project\ndevelopment testing deployment and\nmaintenance let's have a brief\ndescription about each of these stages\nand this is the cycle that the sdlc\nfollows so about stage one the level of\nsdlc that is most crucial and essential\nis requirement analysis with input from\nall the stakeholders domain experts and\nsmes in the industry the senior team\nmembers carry it out at this point\nplanning is also done for the\nrequirements for quality assurance and\nfor the identification of project\nrelated risks so a meeting is scheduled\nwith the client by the business analyst\nand project manager to obtain all the\nnecessary information such as what the\ncustomer wants to construct who will be\nthe end user and what the products goal\nis a fundamental knowledge of\nunderstanding of the product is crucial\nbefore constructing it for example a\nclient requests a financial transaction\nrelated application this approach\nrequires specific requirements such as\nwhat operations will be performed how\nthey will be performed in what currency\nthey will be performed etc once the\nnecessary task has been completed the\nanalysis of the viability of a product's\ngrowth is finished there is a signal set\nup for additional discussion in the\nevent of any ambiguity the srs that is\nsoftware requirement specification\ndocument is prepared once the\nrequirement has been comprehended this\ndocument should be carefully followed by\nthe developers and should also be\nreviewed by the client for future\nreference next we have specifying the\nneeds the process of representing\ndocumenting and getting the project\nstakeholders to approve the software\nrequirements follows the completion of\nthe requirement analysis this is done by\nusing the srs document which contains\nall the product requirements that must\nbe created and developed during the\nproject life cycle\nstage 3 is creating or designing the\nsoftware the knowledge of the software\nproject's needs analysis and design will\nall be revealed in the upcoming phase\nthis phase is the result of the previous\ntwo such as requirement analysis and\nclient input\nstage four is project development the\nactual development phase of the sdlc\nstarts here and programming is created\ncoding represents the start design\nimplementation programming tools\nincluding compilers interpreters\ndebuggers\nand other similar tools are used to\ngenerate and implement the code and\ndevelopers must adhere to the coding\nstandards outlined by the management\nstage 5 is called testing\nfollowing the generation of the code it\nis compared to the requirements to\nensure that the solutions are satisfying\nthe demands identified and acquired\nduring the requirement stage\nunit testing integration testing system\ntesting and acceptability testing are\ncarried out at this level stage six is\ndeployment when the software has been\ncertified and no defects or mistakes\nhave been reported it is put into use\nthe software may then be delivered as is\nor with proposed improvements in the\nobject portion depending on the\nassessment the maintenance of the\nsoftware starts once it has been\ndeployed state 7 is maintenance when the\ncustomer begins utilizing the\ntechnologies that have been designed the\ntrue problems and ongoing needs become\napparent maintenance is the process when\nthe developed product is given attention\nnext we'll talk about the sdlc models\nnamely there are seven\nand\nfirst one is waterfall model then we\nhave v-shaped prototype spiral iterative\nincremental big bang and lastly the\nagile model\nlet's have a brief description about all\nof these models\nthe first model utilized in the sdlc is\nthe waterfall model it is also known as\nlinear sequential model the results of\none phase in this model serve as the\ninput for the following phase only after\nthe preceding phase is finished\ndeveloping can the new phase begin let's\ntake a look at the cycle itself\nfirst requirements are gathered and\nanalyzed only once the requirements have\nbeen set in stone can system design\nbegin\nthe srs document produced in this case\nserves as both an input and\nan output for system design phase\nthen documents that serves as an input\nfrom the following phase implementation\nand coding are prepared throughout the\nsystem design and software architecture\nphases then coding is completed in the\nimplementation phase and the software\ncreated serves as the input for the\ntesting step that follows the developed\ncode is rigorously tested throughout the\ntesting process to find any software\nflaws when a fault is repaired it is\nretested and entered into the defect\ntracking tool\nbug logging retesting and regression\ntesting continues until the software is\nready for use following the customer's\napproval the developed code is put into\nproduction during the deployment phase\nthe developers are responsible for\nfixing any problem that arise in the\nproduction environment\nand fall under maintenance\nnow advantages and disadvantages the\nwaterfall paradigm is an understandably\nstraightforward one in which all steps\nare carried out sequentially each phase\nis deliverables are well specified which\nprevents complexity and makes the\nproject simple to manage not\ndisadvantages the waterfall approach\nrequires a lot of time and cannot be\nutilized for projects with a short\nlifespan because a new phase cannot be\nstarted until the current phase is\nfinished this model expects the\nrequirement to be clear in the\nrequirement analysis phase itself and\nany change in the latest stages would\nresult in higher costs as the changes\nwould be required in all the phases as a\nresult it cannot be used for projects\nwith uncertain requirements or whether\nrequirements keep changing next we'll\ntalk about the v-shaped model\nverification and validation model is\nanother name for this specific model in\nthis methodology development and testing\ngo concurrently and verification and\nvalidation go hand in hand the only\ndifference between the v model and the\nwaterfall model is that in the v model\ntesting and test planning begin earlier\nlet's take a look at the cycle in this\nmodel we have two phases\nthat is the verification phase and the\nvalidation phase under verification\nphase we have requirement analysis that\nis all necessary data is acquired and\nanalyzed in this step examining the\nspecifications is one of the\nverification activities then we have\nsystem design once the requirements are\ndefined a system is designed or the\nproduct's architecture and its\ncomponents are made and recorded in a\ndesign document then we have high level\ndesign the architecture and design of\nmodules are specified by high level\ndesign it specifies how the two modules\nwork together then we have low level\ndesign the individual component\narchitecture and design are described by\nlow level design\nlastly in this phase we have coding in\nthis phase code development is completed\nin the validation phase firstly we have\nunit testing utilizing the unit testing\ncases created during the low level\ndesign phase unit testing is carried out\nin-house unit testing is done by the\ndeveloper it is carried out on\nindividual components which helps find\neffects quickly\nthen we have integration testing\nduring the high level design phase\nintegration testing is carried out\nutilizing integration test cases the\ntesting carried out on integrated\nmodules is known as integration testing\nnext up we have system testing during\nthe system design phase system testing\nis carried out this step involves\ntesting the entire system including\nevery aspect of its functionality lastly\nwe have acceptance testing acceptance\ntesting is carried out in the customer's\nenvironment and is connected to the\nrequirement analysis process now we have\nadvantages and disadvantages for\nadvantages it is a straightforward and\nsimple model smaller projects with\nstated requirements that freeze in the\nearly stages benefit from the v-model\napproach it is a disciplined approach\nthat yields a high quality end product\nfor disadvantages for ongoing projects a\nv-shaped model is not recommended later\nrequirement changes would be\nprohibitively expensive now we'll talk\nabout prototype model the prototype\nmodel is a model in which the software\nprototype is created first comparing\nprototype models to the actual software\nreveals that they perform poorly and\nhave limited functional capabilities\nprototypes are built with dummy\nfunctionalities this is a useful tool\nfor figuring out what the customer\nactually wants let's take a look at the\ncycle to obtain useful user feedback\nsoftware prototypes are created before\nthe final product\nafter taking into account user feedback\nthe prototype is once more examined by\nthe client\nup until the consumer accepts the model\nthis process continues after gathering\nrequirements a rapid design is made and\na prototype is developed\nbefore being delivered to the customer\nfor review the prototype is modified in\nresponse to client comments and the\nclarified requirement then represented\nto the client for review the customer\nmust accept the prototype before the\ngenuine program can be developed the\nwaterfall model approach is used to\nconstruct the actual software now let's\nsee the advantages and disadvantages\nfor advantages because flaws are\ndiscovered considerably earlier during\nprototype models develop costs and time\nare reduced a change in requirement a\nmissing feature or a lack of\nfunctionality can all be found during\nthe assessment process and added to the\nfinalized prototype a customer's\ninvolvement from the beginning clears up\nany misunderstandings about the\nfunctionality's requirements and for the\ndisadvantage the customer can alter the\nrequirements for the finished product\nbecause they're involved in every stage\nof the process which makes the scope\nmore difficult and could extend the time\nit takes to deliver the product\nnext we will talk about the spiral model\niterative and prototype approaches are\npart of the spiral model the iterations\nadhere to the stages of the spiral model\nthe innermost loop in the model is for\nrequirement collecting and analysis\nwhich is followed by planning risk\nanalysis development and evaluation the\nloops in the model represent the phases\nof the sdlc process designing is the\nsecond loop followed by implementation\nand testing now there are four phases in\nthis model let's take a look at the\ncycle\nwe have planning risk analysis\nengineering and evaluation firstly\nplanning gathering requirements is a\npart of the planning step during which\nthe customer is asked for all the\nnecessary information and it is recorded\nthe following phase begins with the\ncreation of software requirement\nspecification document then comes risk\nanalysis the best solution is chosen for\nthe risks involved in this phase and\nanalysis is completed by creating the\nprototype as an illustration there is a\nchance that the data access rate from a\nremote database will be excessively slow\nbuilding a prototype of the data access\nsubsystem will eliminate the risk\nthen we have engineering coding and\ntesting are completed after the risk\nanalysis is done\nand lastly we have evaluation the\ncustomer assesses the system created and\nmakes plans for the following iteration\nlet's talk advantages and disadvantages\nfor advantages the prototype models\nare extensively used for risk analysis\nand the following iteration can include\nany functionality changes or\nimprovements and for disadvantages\nonly huge projects are the greatest\ncandidates for the spiral model and as\nit may require numerous iterations and\ntake a long time to produce the desired\nresult the cost may be substantial\nnext we will talk about the iterative\nincremental model the product is divided\ninto manageable pieces\nby the iterative incremental model for\ninstance a feature that will be created\nduring the iteration is chosen and put\ninto practice phases such as requirement\nanalysis design coding and testing are\ncompleted throughout each iteration\niterations do not require extensive\nforce let's take a look at the cycle\nafter each iteration is finished a\nproject is confirmed and sent to the\nclient for review and feedback the newly\nincorporated feature is combined with\ncustomer feedback in the following\niteration as a result the product gains\nfeatures as iterations go and the final\nbuild has all of the products features\nnow there are four phases in this model\ncalled inception\nelaboration construction and transition\nin inception phase\nthe project's requirements and scopes\nare included in elaboration phase a\nproduct's working architecture which\naddresses the risks\nnoted during the inception phase and\nalso satisfies the non-functional\ncriteria\nduring construction phase\nthe construction phase\nincludes\nof the following the architecture is\nfilled out with deployable code during\nthe construction phase which is\naccomplished\nthrough functional requirement analysis\ndesign implementation and testing\nthen comes the transition phase the\nproduct is introduced into the\nproduction environment\nduring the transition phase\nnow advantages and disadvantages\nany change in the requirement can be\neasily done and would not cost as there\nis a scope of incorporating the new\nrequirement in the next iteration\nrisk is analyzed and identified in the\niterations\ndefects are detected at an early stage\nas the product is divided into smaller\nchunks it is easy to manage the product\nnow disadvantages to break down and\ndevelop progressively a complete grasp\nof a product is necessary\nnow we'll talk about the big bang model\nthe big bang model has no established\nprocess input and output consists of\nmoney and labor and the result is a\ndeveloped good that may or may not be\nwhat the client requires\nlet's take a look at the cycle\nbig bang model doesn't need a lot of\nschedule or planning the developer\nanalyzes the requirements writes the\ncode and creates the product in\naccordance with this knowledge\nthis model is only applied to modest\nprojects the absence of a testing team\nand the absence of formal testing could\nlead to the project's failure\nnow advantages and disadvantages\nfor advantages\nit is an extremely basic model there is\nless need for scheduling and planning\nthe developer has the freedom to create\ntheir own software\nnow for the disadvantage\nlarge ongoing and sophisticated projects\ncannot be handled with big bang model\nand it is highly uncertain and dangerous\nlastly we have the agile model\nincremental and iterative models are\ncombined to create the age oil paradigm\nthis paradigm emphasizes flexibility\nthroughout product development more so\nthan requirements\na product is divided into manageable\nincremental bills in age oil it is not\ncreated in its entirety in one sitting\nthe number of features increases with\neach build the upcoming update expands\nupon earlier features\nlet's take a look at the cycle\nsprints are the term used\nfor iterations in age oil a sprint lasts\nabout two to four weeks each print ends\nwith the product owner verifying it\nbefore it is provisioned to the client\nwith his or her permission customer\nfeedback is used to make improvements\nand the following sprint will focus on\nhis recommendations and enhancements\nnow let's take a look at the advantages\nand disadvantages\nfor advantages it gives you more freedom\nto adjust to the changes the new feature\nis simple to add customer satisfaction\nbecause consider their comments and\nrecommendations at every level\nand for disadvantages there's inadequate\ndocumentation agile requires highly\nqualified and experienced personnel the\nproject would fail if the customer was\nunsure of exactly\nhow they wanted the final result to be\nnow we have come to the conclusion\nfor the project to be successfully\nfinished adherence to an appropriate\nlife cycle is crucial in turn this\nfacilitates management\neach model of the software development\nlifecycle has pros and cons of its own\nthe elements like requirement\nsystem complexity project size\ncost skill limitation etc can help\nestablish the optimal model for any\nproject\nspiral and agile models for instance are\nthe best to utilize when a requirement\nis uncertain because the necessary\nadjustment may be easily accommodated at\nany stage\nand that's it for this video thank you\njust a quick info guys if you want to\nmake a career in

is easy to manage the product\nnow disadvantages to break down and\ndevelop progressively a complete grasp\nof a product is necessary\nnow we'll talk about the big bang model\nthe big bang model has no established\nprocess input and output consists of\nmoney and labor and the result is a\ndeveloped good that may or may not be\nwhat the client requires\nlet's take a look at the cycle\nbig bang model doesn't need a lot of\nschedule or planning the developer\nanalyzes the requirements writes the\ncode and creates the product in\naccordance with this knowledge\nthis model is only applied to modest\nprojects the absence of a testing team\nand the absence of formal testing could\nlead to the project's failure\nnow advantages and disadvantages\nfor advantages\nit is an extremely basic model there is\nless need for scheduling and planning\nthe developer has the freedom to create\ntheir own software\nnow for the disadvantage\nlarge ongoing and sophisticated projects\ncannot be handled with big bang model\nand it is highly uncertain and dangerous\nlastly we have the agile model\nincremental and iterative models are\ncombined to create the age oil paradigm\nthis paradigm emphasizes flexibility\nthroughout product development more so\nthan requirements\na product is divided into manageable\nincremental bills in age oil it is not\ncreated in its entirety in one sitting\nthe number of features increases with\neach build the upcoming update expands\nupon earlier features\nlet's take a look at the cycle\nsprints are the term used\nfor iterations in age oil a sprint lasts\nabout two to four weeks each print ends\nwith the product owner verifying it\nbefore it is provisioned to the client\nwith his or her permission customer\nfeedback is used to make improvements\nand the following sprint will focus on\nhis recommendations and enhancements\nnow let's take a look at the advantages\nand disadvantages\nfor advantages it gives you more freedom\nto adjust to the changes the new feature\nis simple to add customer satisfaction\nbecause consider their comments and\nrecommendations at every level\nand for disadvantages there's inadequate\ndocumentation agile requires highly\nqualified and experienced personnel the\nproject would fail if the customer was\nunsure of exactly\nhow they wanted the final result to be\nnow we have come to the conclusion\nfor the project to be successfully\nfinished adherence to an appropriate\nlife cycle is crucial in turn this\nfacilitates management\neach model of the software development\nlifecycle has pros and cons of its own\nthe elements like requirement\nsystem complexity project size\ncost skill limitation etc can help\nestablish the optimal model for any\nproject\nspiral and agile models for instance are\nthe best to utilize when a requirement\nis uncertain because the necessary\nadjustment may be easily accommodated at\nany stage\nand that's it for this video thank you\njust a quick info guys if you want to\nmake a career in software engineering\nthen intellipaat provides an advanced\ncertification program on software\nengineering and application development\nby eni city council of iit guate and

{"prompt": "Explain this concept from the video LOfGJcVnvAk: in this lecture we'll be studying about\nthreats threats are an important topic\nin operating system and in one of the\nprevious lectures when we discuss about\nprocess management I have shown you the\ndifference between processes and threats\nso I told you that a program under\nexecution is known as a process and\nthreat is a basic unit of execution so\neach program may have a number of\nprocesses associated with it and each\nprocess can have a number of threats\nexecuting in it so thread is a basic\nunit of execution or a basic unit of CPU\nutilization so that is how we can define\na thread it is a basic unit of CPU\nutilization now let us see what\ncomprises of a thread so a thread\ncomprises of a thread ID a program\ncounter a register set and a stack so\neach thread comprises of these four\nunique items and apart from this it\nshares with other threads belonging to\nthe same process it's Code section data\nsection and other operating system\nresources such as open files and signals\nso these are the things that comprises\nof a thread and apart from that the\nthread shares these things like the Code\nsection data section and other operating\nsystem resources are shared between\nthreads belonging to the same process so\nas I told you a process can contain\ndifferent threads so the threads\nbelonging to the same process will share\nthe resources slight open files signals\nCode section data section and other\nthings so that is how a thread is\nbasically made up so a traditional or\nheavyweight process has a single thread\nof control but if a process has multiple\nthreads of control it can perform more\nthan one task at a time so a traditional\nprocess also known as a heavyweight\nprocess had only a single thread of\ncontrol that means it can have only one\nthread but this is not a very efficient\nsystem but if a process is having more\nthan one threads then each thread will\nbe assigned a different task and hence\nthat process can perform more than one\ntask at a time because it is having\nmultiple\nand multiple threats will be performing\nmultiple actions so there we see how\ntreads becomes useful and how using\nthreads makes the system much more\nefficient so here let us try to\nunderstand the concept of threads using\nthese two diagrams so here in the first\ndiagram it is a single threaded process\nwhich we refer to as a traditional or a\nheavyweight process over here so here we\nare having only a single thread so this\nwhole block is considered as a process\nand this process contains only one\nthread and this is the code section the\ndata section the files the registers and\nthe stack belonging to this process so\nthere is only one thread that means this\nprocess can perform only one task at a\ntime but in contrast to this here we\nhave another diagram showing a\nmulti-threaded process so here this\nwhole block represents a multi-threaded\nprocess so it is a single process and it\nis having multiple threads over here so\nif you see there are three threads in\nthis process and each of these threads\nthey have their own stack and registers\nso all these three threads they have\ntheir own stack and registers and if you\nsee on top the code section the data\nsection and the files belonging to this\nprocess are shared by these three\nthreads and each thread they have their\nown stacks and registers so this is a\ndiagram of a multi-threaded process so\nin this case this process can perform\nmultiple tasks at a time because each\nthread will be performing a different\ntask and hence multiple tasks can be\nperformed at a time by the help of this\nmulti-threaded process so from that\nitself we must have understood that it\nis much more efficient as compared to\nthe single threaded process and it will\nmake our computation faster and more\nefficient so in most of the systems that\nwe use today we follow the system of\nmulti-threaded processes it would be\ngood if we can visually see how it works\nin our system in order to understand how\nprocesses are there and how threads are\nassociated with the processes so here I\nhave a small software\nprocessed threats view which helps us to\nsee the processes and the threats\nrunning in our system so if I click here\nI can see the processes running in my\nsystem so I have opened the chromium\nbrowser in my system so here I can see\nthe chrome dot exe processes which are\nrunning in my system so there are quite\na few number of chrome dot exe processes\nrunning in the system now if I want to\nsee the thread associated with it I will\njust click on it and here the details\nabout the thread is populated so there\nare this many number of threads\nassociated with that single chrome dot\nexe process that was for running so as I\ntold you the thread comprises of a\nthread ID so these under IDs of the\nthread which identifies those threads\nuniquely and then these are the context\nswitches and the last context switches\nthat happened so we have discuss about\ncontext switches in one of the previous\nlectures and here there are so many\ninformations about the thread that we\nhave selected now if we come here we can\nsee that there is the address of the\nthread and here we can see the details\nof the stack associated with that\nprocess so I told you that threads also\ncontainer stack so in this way we can\nsee what are the processes running in\nour system and we can also see the\nthreads associated with those processes\nso we clearly see that in this system it\nis following a multi-threaded approach\nso when I click that single process of\nthat chrome dot exe we see that this\nmany number of threads are running\ninside that process so each of these\nthreads may be used for performing a\ndifferent task so in that way the\nbrowser can do more than one task at a\ntime so let's say for example one of the\nprocesses of this browser chrome load\nexe is used for displaying the web page\non the browser window and let's say that\nanother thread is used for downloading\nsomething from the internet so we know\nthat when we are downloading something\nwe can also view the page at the same\ntime so these two things are happening\nsimultaneously that is possible because\nwe are having multiple threads one\nthread is taking care of displaying and\nthe other thread is taking care of\ndownloading so if we were having\na single-threaded process then while the\ndownloading was happening the page could\nnot be displayed or while the page is\nbeing displayed the download will not\nhappen so that is this a simple example\nthat I want to take in order to make us\nunderstand the usage of multi-threaded\nprocesses so different threads perform\ndifferent tasks and hence multiple tasks\ncan be performed in the same time hence\nimproving our efficiency and speed of\ncomputation so we have seen a visual\nexample of how multi thread processes\nare there in our system now let us see\nwhat are the benefits of having\nmulti-threaded processes so from the\nexample that I have taken you must have\nalready understood the benefits of using\nmulti-threaded processes but let us\nunderstand these benefits in more detail\nso the benefits of multi-threaded\nprogramming can be broken down into four\nmajor categories so let's see what they\nare one-by-one so the first benefit is\nresponsiveness multi-threading an\ninteractive application may allow a\nprogram to continue running even if part\nof it is blocked or is performing a\nlengthy operation thereby increasing\nresponsiveness to the user so we are\nhaving a better responsiveness if we\nhave multi-threading so I can explain\nthis using the same example that I took\nabout the web browser since we said that\nwe are having different threads one for\ndisplaying the web page and another one\nfor downloading and let's say that\nanother one for the user to interact\nwith the web page so if only one thread\nwas there then until and unless one of\nthe tasks completes the other task\ncannot be done so the user have to wait\nfor one of the tasks to be complete in\norder to go to the next task but in case\nof multi-threading since different\nthreads are simultaneously performing\ndifferent tasks the responsiveness to\nthe user increases so that is the first\nbenefit of multi-threaded programming\nlet us see what is the next benefit so\nthe next benefit is a resource sharing\nso by default thread share the memory\nand resources of the process to which\nthey belong the benefits of sharing code\nand data is that it allows an\napplication to have several different\nthreads of activity within the same\naddress space so the next benefit is\nresource sharing so when we saw the\ndiagram of\ndifferent processes here we saw that\nthese multiple threats they are sharing\nthe resources of the same process so the\ncode data and files are shared between\nthese three threats so we said that it\nshares with other threats belonging to\nthe same process it's Code section data\nsection and other operating system\nresources suggest open files and signals\nso we see that resource sharing is\nhappening in multi-threaded programming\nso the benefit of sharing code and data\nis that it will allow application to\nhave several different types of activity\nwithin the same address space so we can\nhave several different threats in the\nsame address space of the same process\nso by resource sharing we are making our\nsystem more efficient because it does\nnot need to have separate or dedicated\nresources for each and every threats so\nsharing resource is another benefit of\nmulti-threaded programming so coming to\nthe next benefit we have economy so\nallocating memory and resources for\nprocess creation is costly because\nthreats share resource of the process to\nwhich they belong it is more economical\nto create and context switch threats so\nwe already saw that there is a resource\nsharing happening in case of\nmulti-threading so if there was no\nmulti-threading then we will need to\nhave a separate process for each and\nevery task that has to be performed and\nallocating memory and resources for the\nprocesses is costly because each process\nwill need to have its dedicated\nresources and memory which it may not be\nable to share with other processes but\nin threads as they are able to share the\nresource of the processes to which they\nbelong it is more economical to create\nand switch between threads because we\ndon't need to have those dedicated\nresources they are able to share and\nhence it is economy so this economy it\ncomes from this resource sharing now\nmoving on the next and the last benefit\nthat we have is utilization of multi\nprocessor architectures the benefit of\nmulti-threading can be greatly increased\nin a multiprocessor architecture where\nthreads may be running in parallel\ndifferent processors a single-threaded\nprocess can only run on one CPU no\nmatter how many are available\nmulti-threading on a multi CPU machine\nincreases concurrency so the next\nbenefit we have is utilization of multi\nprocessor architecture so we have\nalready studied about multi processor\narchitecture in this lecture series of\noperating system so multi processor\narchitecture means there are several\nnumber of processors in the world system\nbut if we are not having a\nmulti-threaded approach and instead\nhaving a single threaded process then\nwhat will happen is that if we are\nhaving one process that one process can\nrun on only one processor or on one CPU\nso you may have different CPUs so let's\nsay for example that we are having four\nprocessors in your system but even\nthough you are having four processors\nsince your process is a single threaded\nprocess that single process can run only\non one of the processor so no matter how\nmany number of processors you may have\nhaving a single threaded process will\nrun in only one of the processor but if\nwe are having a multi-threaded approach\nthen what will happen is that we know\nthat in a multi thread approach each\nprocess has different number of threads\nassociated with it so each of these\nthreads can run on these multiple\nprocessors let's say that there are four\nthreads associated with a single process\nand then there are four processors in\nyour system so each of those threads can\nrun on one of the processors so thread\none may run in processor one thread to\nmyrin processor two and so on so in this\nway we see that the tasks are executed\nconcurrently at the same time and hence\nthe process will be completed quicker\nand it is more efficient that is what we\nmean by utilization of multi processor\narchitecture so if we don't have a\nmulti-threaded approach even though we\nhave multi processors it is not very\nuseful because we are not able to make\nuse of the multi processor architecture\nbut in case of multi-threading we are\nable to make use of the multiprocessor\narchitecture hence improving our\nefficiency of computing so these are the\nmain benefits of multi\nprogramming so with this I hope you got\nthe basic idea of threads and what is\nthe meaning of single threaded process\nand multi thread process and we also saw\nthat most of the systems now we follow a\nmulti-threaded approach and we see that\nhow a single process can have multiple\nthreads associated with it and how they\nshare the resources of that process to\nwhich they belong and how these things\nare beneficial for our computing so\nwe'll be studying more things about\nthreads in the coming lectures so for\nnow I hope the basics of thread is clear\nto you\nso thank you for watching and see you in\nthe next one\n[Applause]\n[Music]", "response": "in this lecture we'll be studying about\nthreats

concerns something as\ncostly as software development in that\ncase we suggest a tried and true method\nlike the software development life cycle\nor\nsdlc it's a standardized process that\ndescribes different stages of building\nhighquality software sdlc was conceived\nin the 1970s as a way of formulating the\ndevelopment of large-scale Business\nSystems but it prevails today as a\nreminder of What stages a product goes\nthrough on the way to eventual we hope\nsuccess there are many methodologies\naddressing this sequence of stages that\nyou might have heard of so today we will\ntalk about the phases of sdlc and the\nmethodologies applying\n[Music]\nthem the father of the software\ndevelopment life cycle was a computer\nscientist and a director at Lockheed\nsoftware Technology Center in Austin\nwhen instant\nwroy in his influential article managing\nthe development of large software\nsystems he described implementation\nsteps that are similar to what we use\ntoday there are generally six stages of\nsoftware development covered in\nsdlc planning and\nAnalysis it's sometimes also called\nrequirement analysis or has analysis as\na separate stage before or after\nplanning all in all at this prolonged\nstage the product team collects business\nand use requirements about what the\nfinal product must do and how it should\nwork cost and time estimation scoping\nand other planning activities all go\nhere this is such an extensive phase\nthat we have several videos covering\nsoftware planning so make sure to check\nthem out after this one second is\ndesigning after the planning stage you\nprepare the product's architecture and\ndesign here a software architect\nanalyzes the requirements and sets the\nhighlevel structure of the future\nsystems describing what components on go\nwhere and how they interact with one\nanother they will also select a\ntechnology for development user\nexperience and visual design can also be\ndrafted at this stage clearly without\nthis stage the following one can't\nhappen the next phase development is a\nstage where programmers use the\narchitect's design to write code that\nwill finally turn the vision into a real\nthing this is where some aspects of the\nfinal product will be first revealed to\nstakeholders then testing more quality\nassurance takes place testers and QA\nprofessionals review the products code\nand useability for bugs and errors so\nthey can be fixed before the next\nstage deployment is when the product is\nreleased to the\nusers sometimes this stage is combined\nwith the following one maintenance where\nfeedback is constantly gathered and the\nproduct receives continuous updates and\nsupport this includes both fixes and new\nfeatures sometimes there's a prototyping\nstage between planning and designing a\nprototype is a simplified version of the\nproduct used to validate the idea before\nany major work begins it doesn't even\nhave to be coded the design can be used\nto receive feedback from stakeholders\nand users a prototype is the best way to\nverify requirements with minimal effort\nand costs so the number of phases and\ntheir titles can differ depending on the\nspecifics of the

as\ncostly as software development in that\ncase we suggest a tried and true method\nlike the software development life cycle\nor\nsdlc it's a standardized process that\ndescribes different stages of building\nhighquality software sdlc was conceived\nin the 1970s as a way of formulating the\ndevelopment of large-scale Business\nSystems but it prevails today as a\nreminder of What stages a product goes\nthrough on the way to eventual we hope\nsuccess there are many methodologies\naddressing this sequence of stages that\nyou might have heard of so today we will\ntalk about the phases of sdlc and the\nmethodologies applying\n[Music]\nthem the father of the software\ndevelopment life cycle was a computer\nscientist and a director at Lockheed\nsoftware Technology Center in Austin\nwhen instant\nwroy in his influential article managing\nthe development of large software\nsystems he described implementation\nsteps that are similar to what we use\ntoday there are generally six stages of\nsoftware development covered in\nsdlc planning and\nAnalysis it's sometimes also called\nrequirement analysis or has analysis as\na separate stage before or after\nplanning all in all at this prolonged\nstage the product team collects business\nand use requirements about what the\nfinal product must do and how it should\nwork cost and time estimation scoping\nand other planning activities all go\nhere this is such an extensive phase\nthat we have several videos covering\nsoftware planning so make sure to check\nthem out after this one second is\ndesigning after the planning stage you\nprepare the product's architecture and\ndesign here a software architect\nanalyzes the requirements and sets the\nhighlevel structure of the future\nsystems describing what components on go\nwhere and how they interact with one\nanother they will also select a\ntechnology for development user\nexperience and visual design can also be\ndrafted at this stage clearly without\nthis stage the following one can't\nhappen the next phase development is a\nstage where programmers use the\narchitect's design to write code that\nwill finally turn the vision into a real\nthing this is where some aspects of the\nfinal product will be first revealed to\nstakeholders then testing more quality\nassurance takes place testers and QA\nprofessionals review the products code\nand useability for bugs and errors so\nthey can be fixed before the next\nstage deployment is when the product is\nreleased to the\nusers sometimes this stage is combined\nwith the following one maintenance where\nfeedback is constantly gathered and the\nproduct receives continuous updates and\nsupport this includes both fixes and new\nfeatures sometimes there's a prototyping\nstage between planning and designing a\nprototype is a simplified version of the\nproduct used to validate the idea before\nany major work begins it doesn't even\nhave to be coded the design can be used\nto receive feedback from stakeholders\nand users a prototype is the best way to\nverify requirements with minimal effort\nand costs so the number of phases and\ntheir titles can differ depending on the\nspecifics of the projects or a\nparticular methodology but a common\nunderstanding Remains the Same you start\nwith a plan then then you design and\ndevelop after that you test and then\nrelease a product but by

{"prompt": "Explain this concept from the video vBURTt97EkA: hello everyone and welcome to the first\nlecture in the course operating system\nso operating system is a course that is\nvery important as far as computer\nscience is concerned and also electronic\nstudents you may have this subject in\nyour course so it is equally important\nand this subject it consists mainly of\ntheory as well as problems so we will\nfirst see the theory and also we will be\nsolving the problems related to this\nsubject and we will see what this\nsubject means and what we can learn from\nthis subject so first of all this is\njust an introduction to operating system\nand we will see what this operating\nsystem actually means and what are the\nfunctions of this operating system what\nare the types of operating systems that\nwe have and we will just try to get a\nbrief idea of this subject all right so\nlet's get started so here it says that\nan operating system also abbreviated as\nOS is a program that manages the\ncomputer hardware and it also says it\nalso provides a basis for application\nprograms and acts as an intermediary\nbetween computer user and computer\nhardware so before we understand these\ntwo lines I will be explaining it to you\nwith a diagram so before we go into this\ndiagram here are some examples of some\noperating systems that we widely use\nthese days first is your windows so you\nmay be using Windows in your desktop or\nyour laptops so it is one of the famous\noperating systems used by many people\nand also we have Linux and Ubuntu which\nare also two open-source operating\nsystems that are widely used in your\ndesktops laptops and other devices and\nthen we have the Mac OS which is the\noperating system from Apple so in their\nlaptops or in their mac books they used\nMac OS X and then in iPhones we find iOS\noperating systems and then we have the\nvery famous Android which you must be\nhaving in your phones so Android is one\nof the famous operating systems that is\nused for your mobile devices all right\nso now before we try to understand these\ntwo lines that we have written here let\nus take a diagram to understand the\nbasic structure of\ncomputer system so that we can\nunderstand what is an operating system\nand what does an operating system\nactually do so here I have a diagram\nwhich represents the basic structure or\nthe basic components of a computer\nsystem so first of all in the lowermost\nlevel we have the computer hardware and\nwhat are computer hardware computer\nhardware it consists of resources like\nCPU which is a central processing unit\nand then memory and then the i/o devices\nwhich means input/output devices so your\nresources like the processing units your\nCPU and also your memory memory consists\nof primary memory like your ramps and\nyour secondary memory like your roams so\nthese things also I will be explaining\nit in a detail way in another lecture\nso let's first know that our memory as\nwell as the i/o devices IO devices means\nthe input/output devices these are the\ndevices that you use for either giving\ninput to your system or for getting\noutput out of your system so examples of\ninput devices will include your devices\nlike your keyboards mouse your\nmicrophones these are devices that you\nuse for giving input into the system and\nthen output devices would be that\ndevices that you use for getting output\nout of your systems that would be your\ndevices like monitors or speakers which\ngives you output or which shows you or\nmakes you hear the output those are your\noutput devices so all these things they\nfall under computer hardware so we\ngenerally refer them to as resources\nalright and then on top of this we have\nthe operating system but for now let us\njust forget this operating system for a\nwhile just let's just assume that it is\nnot there and then on top of this\noperating system we have the system or\nthe application programs now there are\ntwo kinds of software's we have which is\nsystem software and application software\nand system software's are the software's\nthat are used to directly modify or\ndirectly give some command to that\ncomputer hardware and operating system\nis also a kind of system software but\nlet's not think about that and just not\nget confused hearing\nthat butters mainly try to understand\nwater application programs application\nprograms are the programs or software's\nthat are used to perform a specific task\nand that can be directly used by the\nuser and these are some examples that we\nhave here versus a word processor word\nprocessors are like your Microsoft\nOffice Word which are software's used\nfor making document files I have\nbelieved that we have all used Microsoft\nWord and then we have spreadsheets\nspreadsheets are like your Microsoft\nExcel ok that is used for making tabular\ndata or for making some calculations in\nyour table or data and then we have\ncompilers so if you are a computer\nscience student you may be knowing what\ncompilers are so compilers are the\nsoftware's that we use for writing our\ncomputer code like your codes like C++ C\nor Java these are written into your\ncompilers and then we have the text\neditors text editors are editors useful\nmodifying or writing text like your\nnotepad WordPad etc and then we have web\nbrowsers web browsers are the software's\nthat enable you to browse the web even\nas you are watching this video in\nYouTube you may be using some web\nbrowser to view this and examples of\nthis are Google Chrome Mozilla Firefox\nInternet Explorer and so on so this is\nnot the only application program that we\nhave we have many many application\nprograms and these are just few examples\nI took to make you understand so these\nare the application programs we have and\non top of that we have the users that is\nlike users like you and me\nwho are trying to use this softwares for\nperforming specific tasks so let us take\na simple example that this user one he\nwants to use the word processor let's\nsay it is Microsoft Office Word so we\nwant to use Word for typing some\ndocuments and he wants to save it to his\nsystem so let's see how he does it so we\nimagine that there is no operating\nsystem over here we just have this user\nand the application programs and then\nthe computer hardware so if you wants to\nwrite a document or if you want to type\nsomething into Microsoft Word then he\nhave to tell the computer how\nwhere that he wants to do it now how can\nhe do it since there is no operating\nsystem he have to explicitly tell the\ncomputer hardware what he wants to do in\nthe form of code so he have to first\nopen the Microsoft Word and he have to\ntell the computer hardware that I want\nto load Microsoft Word so please load it\ninto the main memory and then after it\nis loaded he has to type something and\nwhen he typed something whatever he\ntypes it has to be displayed on the\nmonitor he have to tell the computer\nhardware to do even that you have to\ntell please display the things that I am\ntyping on the computer screen or on the\nmonitor and then after doing all that he\nhave to save it and even for saving it\nyou have to tell the computer hardware\nthat yeah I am done with all my typing\nand now please save this file with a\nparticular file name to my hard disk so\nfor each and every small on my new task\nyou have to perform you have to\nexplicitly tell the computer hardware\nwhat to do and how do you communicate to\nit in the form of codes you have to\nwrite source code you have to write\ncodes for each and everything that you\nhave to perform so we see that it is a\nvery tedious task or it is a very\ndifficult task to do this if there is no\noperating system you have to manually\ntell the computer hardware each and\neverything that you have to do so if it\nwas like this then nobody would actually\nuse a computer system or at least common\npeople would not use the computer system\nbecause it is such a tedious thing and\nit is very difficult to perform even the\nsimplest of tasks so in order to avoid\nthis or to overcome this problem what we\nhave is an operating system so the\noperating system resides between the\ncomputer hardware and the users so it is\na intermediary that acts between the\ncomputer hardware and user so let us\ntake our first example that we have\ntaken suppose the user one wants to type\nsomething and save it into his Microsoft\nWord so what he does he just double\nclick on the Microsoft Word and then the\nrest of the things the operating system\ntakes care of it it just opens it for\nhim and then it makes the screen ready\nfor him for typing and whatever he types\nit\nthe operating system tells the hardware\nwhat to do so that it will be typed and\ndisplayed on the screen and everything\nthat otherwise would have to be done\nmanually by the user is now taken care\nof by the operating system and after\ntyping it he has to save it when he\nsaves it the operating system tells the\ncomputer Hardware where to save it and\nhow to save it and how much memory to\nallocate or saving it and everything is\ndone by the operating system so all\nthose my new things which we otherwise\nhad to do in the absence of operating\nsystem is now done by the operating\nsystem and it becomes very easy for the\nuser to use the computer system so the\nuser just opens the computer he just\ntakes or opens what he wants to use it\nand he just uses it and all the\nunderlying things that has to happen all\nthe communication that has to happen\nbetween the computer hardware and the\nuser is taken care of by the operating\nsystem it does all for the user and does\nthe computing or the usage of computer\nbecomes very easy for the users because\nof the presence of the operating system\nso that is the main task of an operating\nsystem now if we look back at these two\nlines that we have written now it will\nmake sense and now you would understand\nwhat it actually means so let's read it\nonce again an operating system is a\nprogram that manages the computer\nhardware yes we saw that the computer\nhardware how with resources like CPU\nmemory i/o devices everything is managed\nby the operating system now and then it\nalso provides a basis for application\nprograms and acts as intermediary\nbetween the computer user and the\ncomputer hardware so it provides a basis\nfor the application programs so here we\nhave our application programs and it is\ninstalled on the operating system it\nprovides a base for the application\nprograms and also it acts as an\nintermediary between the computer user\nand the computer hardware so here we\nhave the users and here we have the\nhardware and in the operating system it\nacts like an intermediary between the\nuser and the hardware thus making the\nprocess of computation and the usage of\ncomputers seamless and very easy for the\nusers so that is the main fun\nof an operating system and I hope that\nmade you understand what an operating\nsystem actually does now we will be\nseeing some of the types of operating\nsystems that we have and also the\nfunctions of operating system and what\nare the goals that an operating system\nneeds to achieve so here I have some\ntypes of operating system personas badge\noperating system then time-sharing\noperating system distributed operating\nsystem network operating system a\nreal-time operating system multi\nprogramming multi processing and\nmultitasking operating systems so it is\nnot limited to just this but these are\nsome main types of operating systems\nthat we have and don't worry even if you\ndon't understand them I will be doing\nanother lecture where I will explain all\nthe types of this operating system in a\nclear manner I am just introducing this\nto you so that you just get used to the\nterms that we have here so all this\ntypes of operating system they perform\nin a different way based on the need\nthat we have so just remember that much\nand you can keep this few points in mind\nand then let's see what are the\nfunctions of OS so the main functions of\nOS are number one is it is an interface\nbetween the user and the hardware yes we\njust saw that right now we have users\nhere and we have the hardware here and\nit acts like an interface between the\nuser and hardware and then the second\npoint is allocation of resources so I\nalready told you what I mean by\nresources here what we mean by resources\nare the hardware that we have like the\ncentral processing unit the memory and\nthe input/output devices so when I user\nor when different users wants to use the\ndifferent resources so they have to be\nallocated our resources are not\nunlimited we have a limited resources\nthat means we have limited hardware so\nhow this resources should be allocated\nto users in such a way that everybody\ngets their share and it performs in an\nefficient manner all this is done by the\noperating system so it allocates\nresources to different users or\ndifferent processes in a good manner\nthat is the function of the operating\nsystem and then it does the management\nof memory secure\netc so I told you even when we were\ntyping this word processor we have to\nfirst load it into the main memory then\nafter typing it it has to be saved into\nthe secondary memory or the hard disk so\ndon't worry if you don't understand what\nis main memory secondary memory and all\nthis I will be explaining all this to\nyou in a clearer way in the coming\nlectures so just want you to understand\nthat how the memory is managed\nso how things are stored or where they\nare stored everything is managed by the\noperating system and how securely it is\ndone that is also managed light\noperating systems so these are some of\nthe main functions of operating system\nand now let us see what are the goals of\nan operating system so we have studied\nthis much now we must be knowing just by\nstudying all these functions of\noperating system and what it does we can\njust assume what its goals will be\nnumber one is convenience so I told you\nin that example if we were not having an\noperating system how tedious or how\ntough it would be to execute even the\nsmallest of tasks by the user but having\nan operating system on top of our\ncomputer hardware makes it very easy for\nthe user to communicate to the computer\nhardware so it becomes a very convenient\nthing for the user to have this\noperating system so the first goal of\noperating system is to provide\nconvenience and then the second point is\nefficiency now what do we mean by\nefficiency if you were not having the\noperating system and let's say we have\ndifferent users trying to access these\nresources and how would you efficiently\nmanage the resources that you should get\nthis much resources or the other users\nshould get this much resources so if you\ndo it manually it is going to be very\ntough and that is very less chance that\nyou can efficiently manage it so\noperating system by taking care of all\nthese allocations of resources and\nmanagement of memory and everything it\nprovides you an efficient usage of your\nsystem so the first point is a\nconvenience and then the second point is\nefficiency so many operating systems are\ndesigned mainly for convenience some are\ndesign designed for efficiency but\nmostly most or we can say many of the\noperating system are designed for both\nfor both convenience as well as\nefficiency so these are the goals of\noperating system which we achieve by the\nfunctions of this operating system so in\nthis lecture we have seen that types of\nOS we have seen the functions of OS and\nwe have seen what is the basic structure\nand the basic components we have in our\ncomputer system and we see what the\noperating system actually does\nin order to make computation very easy\nfor us and we have also seen some\nexamples of the operating systems that\nwe widely use so I hope this was clear\nto you this was just an introduction to\njust get you started so that you can\nknow what an operating system actually\nis and now you must be understanding how\ncomplex tasks the operating system must\nbe performing so all the design of\noperating system and each and everything\nthat we need to know about this\noperating system we will be studying\nstep by step in this lecture series so I\nhope this introduction was clear to you\nthank you for watching and see you in\nthe next one\n[Applause]\nyou\n[Music]", "response": "hello everyone and welcome to the first\nlecture in the course operating system\nso operating system is a course that is\nvery important as far as computer\nscience is concerned and also electronic\nstudents you may have this subject in\nyour course so it is equally important\nand this subject it consists mainly of\ntheory as well as problems so we will\nfirst see the theory and also we will be\nsolving the problems related to this\nsubject and we will see what this\nsubject means and what we can learn from\nthis subject so first of all this is\njust an introduction to operating system\nand we will see what this operating\nsystem actually means and what are the\nfunctions of this operating system what\nare the types of operating systems that\nwe have and we will just try to get a\nbrief idea of this subject all right so\nlet's get started so here it says that\nan operating system also abbreviated as\nOS is a program that manages the\ncomputer hardware and it also says it\nalso provides a basis for application\nprograms and acts as an intermediary\nbetween computer user and computer\nhardware so before we understand these\ntwo lines I will be explaining it to you\nwith a diagram so before we go into this\ndiagram here are some examples of some\noperating systems that we widely use\nthese days first is your windows so you\nmay be using Windows in your desktop or\nyour laptops so it is one of the famous\noperating systems used by many people\nand also we have Linux and Ubuntu which\nare also two open-source operating\nsystems that are widely used in your\ndesktops laptops and other devices and\nthen we have the Mac OS which is the\noperating system from Apple so in their\nlaptops or in their mac books they used\nMac OS X and then in iPhones we find iOS\noperating systems and then we have the\nvery famous Android which you must be\nhaving in your phones so Android is one\nof the famous operating systems that is\nused for your mobile devices all right\nso now before we try to understand these\ntwo lines that we have written here let\nus take a diagram to understand the\nbasic structure of\ncomputer system so that we can\nunderstand what is an operating system\nand what does an operating system\nactually do so here I have a diagram\nwhich represents the basic structure or\nthe basic components of a computer\nsystem so first of all in the lowermost\nlevel we have the computer hardware and\nwhat are computer hardware computer\nhardware it consists of resources like\nCPU which is a central processing unit\nand then memory and then the i/o devices\nwhich means input/output devices so your\nresources like the processing units your\nCPU and also your memory memory consists\nof primary memory like your ramps and\nyour secondary memory like your roams so\nthese things also I will be explaining\nit in a detail way in another lecture\nso let's first know that our memory as\nwell as the i/o devices IO devices means\nthe input/output devices these are the\ndevices that you use for either giving\ninput to your system or for getting\noutput out of your system so examples of\ninput devices will include your devices\nlike your keyboards mouse your\nmicrophones these are devices that you\nuse for giving input into the system and\nthen output devices would be that\ndevices that you use for getting output\nout of your systems that would be your\ndevices like monitors or speakers which\ngives you output or which shows you or\nmakes you hear the output those are your\noutput devices so all these things they\nfall under computer hardware so we\ngenerally refer them to as resources\nalright and then on top of this we have\nthe operating system but for now let us\njust forget this operating system for a\nwhile just let's just assume that it is\nnot there and then on top of this\noperating system we have the system or\nthe application programs now there are\ntwo kinds of software's we have which is\nsystem software and application software\nand system software's are the software's\nthat are used to directly modify or\ndirectly give some command to that\ncomputer hardware and operating system\nis also a kind of system software but\nlet's not think about that and just not\nget confused hearing\nthat butters mainly try to understand\nwater application programs application\nprograms are the programs or software's\nthat are used to perform a specific task\nand that can be directly used by the\nuser and these are some examples that we\nhave here versus a word processor word\nprocessors are like your Microsoft\nOffice Word which are software's used\nfor making document files I have\nbelieved that we have all used Microsoft\nWord and then we have spreadsheets\nspreadsheets are like your Microsoft\nExcel ok that is used for making tabular\ndata or for making some calculations in\nyour table or data and then we have\ncompilers so if you are a computer\nscience student you may be knowing what\ncompilers are so compilers are the\nsoftware's that we use for writing our\ncomputer code like your codes like C++ C\nor Java these are written into your\ncompilers and then we have the text\neditors text editors are editors useful\nmodifying or writing text like your\nnotepad WordPad etc and then we have web\nbrowsers web browsers are the software's\nthat enable you to browse the web even\nas you are watching this video in\nYouTube you may be using some web\nbrowser to view this and examples of\nthis are Google Chrome Mozilla Firefox\nInternet Explorer and so on so this is\nnot the only application program that we\nhave we have many many application\nprograms and these are just few examples\nI took to make you understand so these\nare the application programs we have and\non top of that we have the users that is\nlike users like you and me\nwho are trying to use this softwares for\nperforming specific tasks so let us take\na simple example that this user one he\nwants to use the word processor let's\nsay it is Microsoft Office Word so we\nwant to use Word for typing some\ndocuments and he wants to save it to his\nsystem so let's see how he does it so we\nimagine that there is no operating\nsystem over here we just have this user\nand the application programs and then\nthe computer hardware so if you wants to\nwrite a document or if you want to type\nsomething into Microsoft Word then he\nhave to tell the computer how\nwhere that he wants to do it now how can\nhe do it since there is no operating\nsystem he have to explicitly tell the\ncomputer hardware what he wants to do in\nthe form of code so he have to first\nopen the Microsoft Word and he have to\ntell the computer hardware that I want\nto load Microsoft Word so please load it\ninto the main memory and then after it\nis loaded he has to type something and\nwhen he typed something whatever he\ntypes it has to be displayed on the\nmonitor he have to tell the computer\nhardware to do even that you have to\ntell please display the things that I am\ntyping on the computer screen or on the\nmonitor and then after doing all that he\nhave to save it and even for saving it\nyou have to tell the computer hardware\nthat yeah I am done with all my typing\nand now please save this file with a\nparticular file name to my hard disk so\nfor each and every small on my new task\nyou have to perform you have to\nexplicitly tell the computer hardware\nwhat to do and how do you communicate to\nit in the form of codes you have to\nwrite source code you have to write\ncodes for each and everything that you\nhave to perform so we see that it is a\nvery tedious task or it is a very\ndifficult task to do this if there is no\noperating system you have to manually\ntell the computer hardware each and\neverything that you have to do so if it\nwas like this then nobody would actually\nuse a computer system or at least common\npeople would not use the computer system\nbecause it is such a tedious thing and\nit is very difficult to perform even the\nsimplest of tasks so in order to avoid\nthis or to overcome this problem what we\nhave is an operating system so the\noperating system resides between the\ncomputer hardware and the users so it is\na intermediary that acts between the\ncomputer hardware and user so let us\ntake our first example that we have\ntaken suppose the user one wants to type\nsomething and save it into his Microsoft\nWord so what he does he just double\nclick on the Microsoft Word and then the\nrest of the things the operating system\ntakes care of it it just opens it for\nhim and then it makes the screen ready\nfor him for typing and whatever he types\nit\nthe operating system tells the hardware\nwhat to do so that it will be typed and\ndisplayed on the screen and everything\nthat otherwise would have to be done\nmanually by the user is now taken care\nof by the operating system and after\ntyping it he has to save it when he\nsaves it the operating system tells the\ncomputer Hardware where to save it and\nhow to save it and how much memory to\nallocate or saving it and everything is\ndone by the operating system so all\nthose my new things which we otherwise\nhad to do in the absence of operating\nsystem is now done by the operating\nsystem and it becomes very easy for the\nuser to use the computer system so the\nuser just opens the computer he just\ntakes or opens what he wants to use it\nand he just uses it and all the\nunderlying things that has to happen all\nthe communication that has to happen\nbetween the computer hardware and the\nuser is taken care of by the operating\nsystem it does all for the user and does\nthe computing or the usage of computer\nbecomes very easy for the users because\nof the presence of the operating system\nso that is the main task of an operating\nsystem now if we look back at these two\nlines that we have written now it will\nmake sense and now you would understand\nwhat it actually means so let's read it\nonce again an operating system is a\nprogram that manages the computer\nhardware yes we saw that the computer\nhardware how with resources like CPU\nmemory i/o devices everything is managed\nby the operating system now and then it\nalso provides a basis for application\nprograms and acts as intermediary\nbetween the computer user and the\ncomputer hardware so it provides a basis\nfor the application programs so here we\nhave our application programs and it is\ninstalled on the operating system it\nprovides a base for the application\nprograms and also it acts as an\nintermediary between the computer user\nand the computer hardware so here we\nhave the users and here we have the\nhardware and in the operating system it\nacts like an intermediary between the\nuser and the hardware thus making the\nprocess of computation and the usage of\ncomputers seamless and very easy for the\nusers so that is the main fun\nof an operating system and I hope that\nmade you understand what an operating\nsystem actually does now we will be\nseeing some of the types of operating\nsystems that we have and also the\nfunctions of operating system and what\nare the goals that an operating system\nneeds to achieve so here I have some\ntypes of operating system personas badge\noperating system then time-sharing\noperating system distributed operating\nsystem network operating system a\nreal-time operating system multi\nprogramming multi processing and\nmultitasking operating systems so it is\nnot limited to just this but these are\nsome main types of operating systems\nthat we have and don't worry even if you\ndon't understand them I will be doing\nanother lecture where I will explain all\nthe types of this operating system in a\nclear manner I am just introducing this\nto you so that you just get used to the\nterms that we have here so all this\ntypes of operating system they perform\nin a different way based on the need\nthat we have so just remember that much\nand you can keep this few points in mind\nand then let's see what are the\nfunctions of OS so the main functions of\nOS are number one is it is an interface\nbetween the user and the hardware yes we\njust saw that right now we have users\nhere and we have the hardware here and\nit acts like an interface between the\nuser and hardware and then the second\npoint is allocation of resources so I\nalready told you what I mean by\nresources here what we mean by resources\nare the hardware that we have like the\ncentral processing unit the memory and\nthe input/output devices so when I user\nor when different users wants to use the\ndifferent resources so they have to be\nallocated our resources are not\nunlimited we have a limited resources\nthat means we have limited hardware so\nhow this resources should be allocated\nto users in such a way that everybody\ngets their share and it performs in an\nefficient manner all this is done by the\noperating system so it allocates\nresources to different users or\ndifferent processes in a good manner\nthat is the function of the operating\nsystem and then it does the management\nof memory secure\netc so I told you even when we were\ntyping this word processor we have to\nfirst load it into the main memory then\nafter typing it it has to be saved into\nthe secondary memory or the hard disk so\ndon't worry if you don't understand what\nis main memory secondary memory and all\nthis I will be explaining all this to\nyou in a clearer way in the coming\nlectures so just want you to understand\nthat how the memory is managed\nso how things are stored or where they\nare stored everything is managed by the\noperating system and how securely it is\ndone that is also managed light\noperating systems so these are some of\nthe main functions of operating system\nand now let us see what are

{"prompt": "Explain this concept from the video WjwEh15M5Rw: [Music]\nhello everyone my name is Michaan's\nand I'm gonna be your instructor for the\nday now the main topic of the day is to\nunderstand what do you mean by agile\ndevelopment and how can it actually help\ndifferent organizations to have better\napproach to deploying the application\nthat they have I've been working as a\nDevOps engineer with multiple\ndevelopment teams for the past 10 years\nthis session is being conducted on\nbehalf of Eddie Rekha\nnow the agenda for the day is a few very\nsimple questions that you would need\nanswered in order to actually make sense\nof what do people mean when they say\nthat you're HR so why do we need a job\nwhat is even ajar development the key\nterms of agile the advantages over\nciaochao and how do you implement agile\nin your organization or the team that\nyou're working with and the various\nmethods philosophies and the frameworks\nthat are available to actually implement\na job in the team that you have so back\nin the day there was something called as\nwaterfall development or the waterfall\nmodel of development so when I say\nwaterfall you can think about something\nlike you know a banking application or\ninsurance application or some Police\nDepartment application so the moment I\nsay waterfall model you can think of\nlike a really huge application which is\nyou know made up of small chunks of code\nfor example this application might have\na front-end this application would\nobviously have a back-end and then it\nhas some DNS routes and a few services\nthat it's dependent on so it doesn't\nreally matter how many services are part\nof this application but this entire\napplication was shipped as a one-hole\napplication that's how they used to\nhappen back in the day and this was\nreferred to or this method of\ndevelopment the waterfall method the\napplication was referred to as a\nmonolithic application now it's called\nmonolithic if I can write it properly\nmonolithic application now you know\neverything was fine in D&D unless like\ntwo thousands\n2002 and that's when things started to\nbecome a bit extreme because the clients\nwould have ten different requirements\nthat would change almost every day now\nif you have one single application you\nhave a single point of failure so if we\nwere changing even this limb part of\nthis application and if this part was to\nfail this entire application would stop\nworking that's when people started\nbrainstorming about better approaches to\nsoftware development and how can you\nmeet the requirements of the millennium\nof the today's world - without actually\naffecting how the software is written or\nany application is written in the first\nplace that's where the ideas of agile\ndevelopment came into the picture so\nthat was one part of the problem the\nsecond part of the problem was because\nit was a monolithic application the time\nthat it required to actually push the\nchanges for example let's say you have\nan application up and running in your\nproduction environment and your\ndevelopment team actually created a new\nfeature or they modify the existing\nfeature now that feature is supposed to\ngo in production right but it actually\nused to take days and months back in the\nday because you would never really know\nwhat's going to happen if you put it to\nproduction today there are so many\nmoving parts that you never sure if it's\ngoing to break the existing application\nthat you have so people used to actually\nshould do the maintenance I'm pretty\nsure you would have received those\nemails right like B will be unavailable\nduring this weekend because there is a\nscheduled downtime now that's what used\nto happen now that cannot really fly\nanymore right think about companies like\nNetflix uber Amazon they can't really be\ndown even for a moment because you never\nreally know how many people are\naccessing the service now that is the\nsecond part of the problem that people\nwere trying to solve\nthat's when agile came into the picture\nnow agile put in simple terms is a\nphilosophy to rapidly deploy an\napplication in much more organized way\nnow obviously there is a lot more\ndetails than meets the eye but in a\nsimple sentence that's what you mean by\na jar you want rapid deployment of the\nsoftware or the code that you\nwriting without having to wait for a\nlonger time at the same time you want to\nmake sure that you have small chunks of\ncode that can be shipped to the client\nor whichever application you're working\nwith that's the reason Rajal exists\ntoday and now we're going to look at\nwhat do you mean by agile and how can\nyou actually implement this so I hope we\nare pretty clear about why was there a\nrequirement of agile to begin with this\nis what you mean by waterfall model now\nthis is the traditional software\nbuilding practice right so you would\ngather the requirements you would design\nor architect how you imagined your\nsoftware to be and then there would be\nactually coding that would be executed\nthere would be verification and there\nwould be maintenance post deployment so\nthis is what has been happening for the\npast four decades but this won't really\nfly in today's world because there are\nmultiple changes being pushed every\nsingle day so you can't really just go\nthrough the months of planning for a\nlittle change so the way applications\nare developed have changed and so is the\nway applications are deployed so that's\nwhat you mean by waterfall models now I\nthink I have explained it pretty well\nthere are a lot of companies that still\nfollow this model but at the end of the\nday all of them are trying to you know\nmigrate to a more agile development it's\nnot so easy depending on the size of the\ncompany but you will still see a few\ncompanies using waterfall and they are\nin process of moving away from this\nmodel then comes our child to rescue so\nwhat is agile we've talked about the\nrequirement or void as agile even exist\nso far now let's look at what do you\nmean by a chef so agile is nothing but a\nchain of rapid development and\ndeployment meaning the first section of\nyour software development is always the\nplanning part but now you obviously know\nwhat you're about to build but you kind\nof break that entire application down\ninto small chunks of code and then you\nwork on those small services one service\nat a time ensuring that first of all you\nkind of follow the micro services model\nand at the same time you don't really\naffect the entire application in general\nso you plan you\ndesign you architect and you actually\ndevelop the application you test you\ndeploy it and you review it if you\nnotice launch is actually outside of\nthis entire circle meaning every time\nyou make a change it could be something\nas simple as just one line of code\nchange just available being renamed so\nit doesn't matter how small or how big\nthe changes the idea is the moment the\nchange is made it has to be deployed\neven in a dev environment so that you\ncan get a constant feedback over what's\nhappening with the code that you have\nimagine if you actually had to wait for\none month or two weeks just to get the\nfeedback on if you really want that\nchange or not now that could be a little\nannoying or frustrating from the\ndevelopers point of view so that's the\nfirst aspect of agile you plan you\ndesign you develop you test you deploy\nthe changes and then you review the\nchanges before you actually launch them\ninto production the other major aspect\nof agile is now instead of working with\nlike a huge chunk of application you\nwork in iterations so when I say\niterations what I mean is you have a\nspecific set of tasks that have to be\ncompleted in specific priority so that\nyou already know what you're supposed to\nbe working on and you are not really\nworried about ten different micro\nservices at the same time you have a\nspecific requirement where you should be\nfocused so you have the first iteration\nwhich might be the first part of your\napplication\nsecond iteration third iteration so\nthink about it this way if you have\nAmazon or any if you're working for you\nknow amazon.com or Amazon tour in which\nis the shopping website you might visit\namazon.com and you might think yeah it's\na one website it's not really one\nwebsite it's a website that's broken\ndown into several other services for\nexample the website itself might be\ncalled a front-end now the moment you\nreach to amazon.com you can click on a\nproduct right and then you can view the\ndetails of a product so that service\nit's not really a part of the front-end\nanymore that is being called from\nsomething else called as catalog now\nonce you decide that this is a\nproduct that I want to buy you click on\nbuy now and then it's going to take you\nto something called a shopping cart and\nafter you made the payments and all\nthose things you have email\nnotifications and you know text\nnotifications the point here is even\nthough all of these things are working\nin synergy they are actually completely\nseparate services completely separate\ntasks in the underlying architecture so\nif I am working on something on the\nfront end I don't really have to be\nworried about the catalogs and the\nshopping because first I am getting a\nconstant feedback even before the launch\nI am getting a feedback about what's\ngonna happen once we launch your code to\nthe production at the same time I don't\nreally have to be afraid that it's gonna\nbreak my entire application because all\nof them are developed as separate\nmicro-services your one service will\nnever affect another service of course\nthe dependent services might be affected\nbut the idea is you never really want a\nsingle point of failure that's the idea\nof a jar now let's move forward now what\nare the terms and the values of our job\nso the first value is people over\nprocesses and tools working software\nover comprehensive documentation\ncustomer collaboration over rigid\ncontracts and responding to change\nrather than following a plan so people\nover process and tools this kind of who\ngives you you know a development centric\nand client centric environment meaning\njust because you've been doing something\nin a traditional way for the past eight\nyears it does not mean you don't really\nexplore the options that you have right\nnow for example whatever you did with\nPHP my sequel yesterday can also be done\nwith Python and flask today right I'm\nnot saying change your entire\napplication what I'm saying is the model\nis pretty much people centric the people\nlike the development team and the\ncustomers and the end users are given\nmore importance and working software\nover comprehensive documentation now\nthis is something that all of us would\nhave noticed at some point in time right\nso every application would have an\ninternal document of how long 100 pages\n150 pages about all the class\nall the methods how the application is\nbeing built then why the application is\nbeing built who's the owner in like\nplethora of other details that you as an\nindividual is not even concerned about\nyou are concerned about what you have to\nbuild and how far along are you in that\ndevelopment task so in agile the\nfunctional application is given much\nmore importance than the documentation\nbecause if you think about it the code\nitself is a documentation right if you\nknew how to interpret the code you could\nlook at the code and that can also act\nas an documentation so I'm not saying\nthat won't be any documentation all I'm\nsaying is the development is given more\nimportance over the documentation part\nand then customer collaboration over\nrigid contracts and responding to change\nrather than following the plan so agile\nis really feedback dependent meaning\nback in the day you know the managers\nand the product owners will have\nmultiple meetings they'll come up with\nthe kind of software that they bought\neverything would be discussed over like\nthree four months and then people would\nwant to stick to the plan because you\nalready spent four months planning this\nthing now if you wanted to change even a\nlittle part of this the entire meetings\nand planning would have to be done all\nover again\nnow agile changes that agile works more\non the feedback just because the plan\nhas been made it does not mean that\ncannot be any changes because you've\nbroken things down into smaller chunk of\ntasks any one of the tasks can be\nmodified according to the requirements\nat any point in time so these are the\nvalues that agile bring to the table\nright so there are two parts of the\npuzzle you have a benefit in the new\ntable of value so benefit is what you\nget like right off the bat and value is\nwhat you derive out of it so what we saw\nbefore were the values where everyone\nyou know on the table receives some of\nthe other kind of benefit because of our\njob principles of agile satisfied\ncustomer welcomed changing requirements\ndeliver working software frequently\nfrequent iterations with stakeholders\nmotivated individuals face-to-face\ncommunications measured by working\nsoftware main\nin constant pace sustained technical\nexcellence in good design keep it simple\nempower self-organizing team reflect and\nit just continuously now this might look\nmore like a textbook think like here are\nthe 10 benefits you know just go with a\njob but that's not really the case we\nare actually going to look at how all of\nthis materializes like you know over the\nfuture slides when we actually talk\nabout how can you implement a job in the\nworking or the team that you're working\nwith\nso let's more now advantages of agile do\nyou pretty much kind of you know touched\nupon all of these things for now\npersistence software delivery increased\nstakeholder satisfaction inspect and\nadapt\nwelcome to changes at any stage design\nis important and daily interactions\nnow comes the meat of the entire\npresentation now you have a basic idea\nof Persia right but question that\neverybody has at any point in time is\nwhat's in it for me okay you told me\nwhat's a gel and how can I tell but how\ncan it help me as an individual or how\ncan I actually implement a job so there\nare multiple frameworks or philosophies\nwhen it comes to agile so scrum extreme\nprogramming lean Kanban crystal are some\nof the examples the most popular one out\nthere\nit's called scrum now again these\nphilosophies are not really set in stone\nit's not like if you following scrum\nthat you know it's 100% what scrum\ndictates you how to do it that way\nthat's not really the case in majority\nof the cases what people do is they\nprimarily implement scrum and then they\nhave some ideas from canva and extreme\nand lean and then they kind of have\ntheir own philosophy that works for\ntheir organization but scrum is the one\nthat's used by the majority of the\npeople so even before looking at the\nslide you know before we go through what\nwe see in the slide I can just kind of\nexplain scrumpy you the way I know it\nright because I worked with multiple\ndevelopment teams I've seen most of\nthese being implemented and I know how\neach one of them work in the real world\nexample so what is scrum so scrum is\nbasically an iterative philosophy\nmeaning\nyou I trade over the changes you I trade\nover the deployments and software\ndevelopment one at a time so if you\nwanted to talk about scrum scrum is an\niteration of plan then build\nthen Cass\nand then review\nnow you would constantly be iterating\nover all of these aspects now what do I\neven mean by this so let's first look at\nhow or what does a scrum implemented\nteam looks like so in scrum implemented\nteam you have the very first person that\nI want to talk about someone corners\nproduct owner\nnow when I say product owner if you're\ncoming from you know more of a\ntraditional software development\nenvironment you can think of a product\nowner as a manager he is the guy who\nholds the responsibility to make sure\nthat the application is deployed as and\nwhen committed at the same time the\napplication is built exactly as the way\nit has to be built so product owner is\nthe guy with the ideas he might not\nnecessarily be a technical person he\nmight as well be a guy from the\nmanagement he does not necessarily have\nto know the development or the\ntechnicalities in detail he's the guy\nwith the idea and the owner of the\napplication that would be developed so\npretty much all the accountability lies\non him and then there is someone called\na scrum master\nnow scrum master is someone that you\nwould have traditionally referred to as\na team leader or a project owner now you\ncan think about scrum master as a team\nleader in the hierarchical sense this is\nthe person that's right below the\nproduct owner and this is the person who\nactually does the data or handles the\nday-to-day operations like you know\nrunning the meetings or handing the\ntasks that have to be done and then you\nhave the team itself which will consist\nof your developers and testers and you\nknow depending on your requirement it\nmight have a few more roles but then you\nhave the actual team but we'll execute\nthe tasks so these are the three roles\nthat you have but now that we know the\npeople that are involved how exactly\nthis works I mean this looks pretty much\nsimilar to what you do at your office\nit's just fancy names right you have a\nmanager you have a team leader and you\nhave a team so how is it any different\nfrom what you do at your office so\nthat's what we want to look at now I\nhope the roles are kind of clear to you\nnow that you have the roles defined\nlet's look at the first thing about the\ndevelopment so the first part of the\ndevelopment that we want to look at it's\ncalled product\nbacklogs\nnow here's where things start to get a\nbit different from how you might have\nbeen working at a traditional\nenvironment now in a traditional\nenvironment you have an application that\nhas been already planned for months and\nyou along with others have been working\non deploying the application and you\nknow the project usually goes on for a\nfew months or even a year or two\ndepending on the size of the project now\nin product backlogs you actually have\nthe same application iterated over in\nsmaller tasks so when I say smaller\ntasks you can think about the same\namazon.com about so the first iteration\nwill have plan it will have build it\nwill have test and it will have review\nnow in this case I'm not really building\nthe whole application I obviously have\nan idea as to what the application is\nsupposed to look like but for now let's\nsay I'm only concerned about the\nfront-end or what the main or the\nprimary website would look like then I\nhave a second iteration where I would\nyou know the same cycle plan build test\nand review but this is where I'm\nactually working with email notification\nI'm actually coding how would my email\nnotifications be sent out and you know\nhow do you manage the email queues and\nthe rest of the things and then you have\na third iteration which might just be\nyour payment processing so in this case\nagain the same cycle you plan you build\nyou test and you review but the benefit\nhere is that once you have the product\nbacklog these are all your product\nbacklogs these are the things that are\nsupposed to be done over a period of\ntime so the first thing you do is you\ndefine the product backlogs not you as a\ndeveloper but the product owner and the\nscrum master these are the people that\nwill actually come up with all the\nbacklogs instead of you know just one\nsingle application that says I want this\nthing to work they actually break it\ndown into small chunks of code so that\nis the job of the product owner and the\nscrum master because as I said product\nowner might not be a technical guy\nnecessarily so scrum master is the one\nthat would all\nyour technical right right so both of\nthem would come up with a product pad\nRox\nonce you have a product backlog there is\nsomething called as user stories so each\none of these would now be referred to as\nuser stories and your scrum master\nactually ends up prioritizing them\nmeaning if you have front-end email\npayment processor and ten other backlogs\nthat have to be developed let's say over\nnext five or seven months in that case\nthe scrum master and the product owner\nwould kind of prioritize now obviously\npayment processor is of no use if you\ndon't even have a project so logically I\nwould want to prioritize my front-end\nover my payment processor so scrum\nmaster and product owner will prioritize\nthe user stories that you have and\ndepending on the priorities that has\nbeen said they come up with something\ncalled a sprint backlog\nnow spread backlog is when your\ndevelopment team actually gets involved\nin this because now you already have an\norganized and prioritized user stories\nthat you are supposed to be working on\nso ten different things are not just\ndumped on you at the same time you are\ngiven a logical and reasonable tasks\nthat have to be executed one at a time\nand once he has a sprint backlog you can\nactually start working on it as a\ndevelopment now I'll get rid of this\nbeautiful drawing that are made for now\nthen let's just look at now a sprint\nbacklog\nI'm sorry I can't really you know write\nwith my mouse but I hope you realize\nit's called sprint now there are\ndifferent you could call them ceremonies\nor rituals but there is something called\na sprint planning\nnow the sprint planning again it's just\na fancy name for the makings and\ndiscussions that you have during the\nsprint planning the product owner will\nactually explain how he imagines the end\ngoal or the product for the application\nto look like so you have something\ncalled a sprint planning you have\nsomething called its daily scrum now\ndaily scrum is nothing more than you\nknow the 15 minutes meeting that happens\nevery day where the developers and the\ntesters and any other role that you have\nin the game can actually discuss what\nhappened and where you stand if you need\nany help there any blockades and what do\nyou plan to do today or tomorrow and\nthen there is something called a sprint\nreview so sprint review actually occurs\nat the end of the user story or the\nbattle that you've been working on so\neach and every one of these user stories\nright they usually are designed with the\ntimeline of two weeks in mind now some\ncompanies the Sprint's may vary like it\ncould be two weeks to four weeks but in\nmajority of the cases each sprint will\nlast two weeks so that you know exactly\nwhat you're supposed to do for the next\ntwo weeks now at the end of the two\nweeks along with you know you're\nplanning your daily meetings once your\nsprint is completed you have a sprint\nreview but you actually demo of the code\nthat you have or you know there's some\nkind of verification to make sure that\nSprint is actually completed and then\nyou move on to a new sprint or you move\non to a new user story that you have to\nwork on so that's the idea that's how\nthings work in general now with that in\nmind if we move on to the next slide\nthis is what the scrum looks like so you\nhave a product backlog and then you have\na sprint planning now as I mentioned\nbefore each one of these Sprint's the\ntimeline is usually a couple of weeks\ndepending on the size of your\norganization it might last up to a month\nbut for all the companies are outward\nwith it's always been between 1 to 3\nweeks so you plan for what has to be\ndone during the next two weeks and then\nyou have the user story or the backlog\nthat you're supposed to work on and then\nyou have your team that actually works\non it along with the daily scrum\nso you have the daily meetings at the\nsame time and at the end of the sprint\nyou have the review and then you ship\nthe part that you code it now when I say\nyou ship the part I don't mean you\nnecessarily put it in production but you\nknow that the part is ready to be\nassembled into the application that you\nhave so the idea is at the end of every\ntwo weeks you have a shippable part of\nthe application that is ready to be\ndeployed so instead of working a huge\napplication that would have taken a year\nanyway now you kind of break it down\ninto things that can be actually shipped\nin two weeks depending on the priorities\nthat have been set by the product owner\nand the scrum master that you have\nthat's the idea of scrum to break\neverything down into smaller chunks of\ncoal smaller chunks of tasks so that\neveryone knows exactly what they're\nsupposed to do that's like the\nmethodical part of it right you have a\nmethod there is a specific best set of\npractices that you following along with\nthe technical side because you have a\nrapid deployment the moment you write a\ncode you can actually test it in the dev\nenvironment now that's where people like\nme\nDevOps come into the picture but the\nidea is you don't really have to wait\nfor a month just to see what you code it\nright now if you push the code right now\nin matter of minutes you would actually\nsee that working in the dev environment\nso that's the technical side you have\nthe instant feedback to figure out if\nyou have to move on or you know if you\nhave to make some changes to the code\nthat you have right now now that's crumb\nand agile in general then there is a\nsecond method so scrum was one of the\nphilosophies or framework then you have\nsomething called as extreme programming\nnow this was one of the first ones a\ngroup of developers came up with it back\nin 2001 I think the guy was called Kent\nso they kind of came up with the idea of\nagile development they came up with a\nset of best practices and then they even\nsigned a manifest so they actually came\nup with a manifest that you know these\nare the things that we should be\nfollowing in the industry these are the\nbest practices and these are the\nprinciples and they even signed it so\nextreme programming has been around for\nalmost a couple of decades and scrum is\nkind of the next iteration of extreme\nprogramming it's a big different but as\nI said before majority of the\norganizations using scrum programming so\nin extreme programming they came up with\nyou know the basic sets of principles\nlike people centric environment\ndiscipline and then you have rapid\ndeployment so project requirements\nstories test cases task completion\ncustomer input iteration planning now\nboth of these things are happening in\nparallel so you have project\nrequirements you have stories test cases\ntasks and completion and at the same\ntime you have customer input and at some\npoint you have customer relations in the\nmeeting for example you developed 20% of\nthe application and your end user or\nyour client came back with a better idea\nor if they need some modifications so\nthose are the changes then you have your\nUNT testing you have client side duty\ntesting and acceptance at the end of it\nso extreme programming the ideas are\nsomewhat similar to scrum but at the end\nof the day all of these philosophies are\ntrying to make the lives of developers\nthe end users better and not\ncompromising on technicalities rather\nmaking the shippable product better and\nfaster is the idea all right let's move\non then you have lean programming so\nlean principles even this has been\naround for a while so eliminate waste\namplify learning decide as late as\npossible decide as fast as possible\nempower the team build integrity and see\nthe whole yeah so you could call it a\nframework you could call it a philosophy\nor methodology now it really depends on\nyou know the word that you want to use\nbut at the end of the day it's again\ntrying to become a developer centric and\npeople centric and setting best\npractices to make sure everyone in the\nteam knows exactly what they're supposed\nto do and you have a cross-functional\nteam when I say cross-functional\nessentially I'm pretty sure if you're\nwatching this video is because you have\nsome of the other development experience\nand if you do then you would have come\nacross this point right when you talk to\nsomeone okay\nyou've seen that feature and we looked\nat the code and that guy would be like\nyou know that code doesn't concern me\nit's none of my concern\nI'm working on something completely\ndifferent you know we are used to that\nsort of development right where people\nindividually know what they're supposed\nto do and they're not even worried about\nwhat the other person is doing now it's\ntime we actually break the silos just\nbecause you're not coding that part it\ndoes not mean that the code does not\nconcern the part of the code that you\nare writing so everybody has to come\ntogether and work on the same\napplication which is what you'll call a\ncross-functional team in the scrum\nexample once you have the user stories\nand the backlogs that you are supposed\nto work on in the next two weeks it\ndoesn't really matter what role do you\nplay in the team it's your team's\nresponsibility to make sure that the\ntask has been completed and the task is\nalso being designed with the timeline in\nmind so it's not like you're expected to\ndo a six weeks worth of development in\ntwo weeks so the task itself is designed\nwith the timeline in mind and then you\nhave something like Kanban so Kanban is\nsimilar to scrum the difference here is\nin case of scrums you have you know\nsmaller chunks of backlogs that you're\nsupposed to work on for the next two\nweeks or three weeks in case of Kanban\nit's a continuous process so there is no\nsuch thing as sprint in can be what you\ndo in Kanban is you have a list of tasks\nthat are supposed to be done and for\nexample you have something like you know\na whiteboard\nyou have a build queue you have a test\nqueue and you have a ship queue now this\nis a hypothetical example you would\nobviously have plan and the rest of the\nX but the point is you might have four\nthings that have to be built or let's\njust say three services that have to be\nbuilt and once the first service has\nbeen built it actually moves on to the\ntesting you and then this place is\noccupied by another service and once\nthis is done this is moved on to testing\nand this is occupied by another service\nmeanwhile if this testing is done it\nwill move to the ship queue and it will\neventually be shipped so the idea is\nwhatever tasks have been achieved will\nbe the placed by a new item in the queue\nso if you have a build Q test queue and\nship you all of these would be moving\nparts so if your job is to build this\nand let's say your colleague drove this\nprotest this the moment you push this\nfirst item into the testing you another\nitem will replace this first item so\nthat you know what is the next thing\nthat you are supposed to be working on\nso Kanban is more like a continuous\nimplementation of the software\ndevelopment so that's what you mean by\nagility in general even if you think\nabout it\nthe English word agility means to be\nreally rapid right agility would mean\nwhatever you're doing is happening in\nrapid succession\nright that's what you mean by agility in\ngeneral so in case of development by\nbringing agility to your team you are\nensuring that everyone's happy at the\nend of the day and you still have a\ntechnically smarter team that's able to\nget instant feedback now I'll give you a\nquick example of this now I'm pretty\nsure all of us or at least most of us\nare aware about Netflix now you would be\nsurprised to know that Netflix is\npushing more than 1,000 changes every\nday into their productions if you\nactually worked at a Netflix development\nteam you would know that these guys are\npushing a thousand changes in production\nevery day now how do you think that's\npossible obviously they are not pushing\nit to production without reviewing it so\nwithout testing it even with all of\nthose things in place how are they able\nto deploy more than 1,000 changes every\nday now these could be very little\nchanges like you know some UI fixes some\ndatabase fixes some payment process and\nfixes so we are not really concerned\nabout what the changes are but I know\nfor a fact that that's the number that's\nthe amount of changes that they actually\npush every day that's possible because\nyou mean the rapid deployment by agility\nor by becoming a jar so that's the level\nof agility you can actually obtain the\nmoment you have an organized team that\nis working on the principles of a jar\nnow obviously there are external factors\nlike you know how's your infrastructure\nhow's your time off stream but it is\npossible at the end of the day and then\nthere is one more framework that's\ncalled Crystal so these are the ideas of\na job now I hope I was cleared into how\ncan i shall help your team in becoming a\nbetter development team so there are\nthree aspects of it right philosophical\ntechnical and the way software is built\nso philosophical being the best\npractices like how do you define your\nteam's who is a scrum master who's a\nproduct owner what's the team what is a\nsprint what are the tasks that you're\nsupposed to do then you have the\ntechnical side of it like if you build a\ncode how exactly can you deploy the code\nlike automatically how can you review\nthe code how can you test the code\nautomatically and then there is a\nsoftware development aspect of it that\nyou are moving away from a monolithic\napplication towards the idea of micro\nservices so these are the three aspects\nthat move parallely and at the end of\nthe day it gives you a peace of mind it\ngives your product manager a peace of\nmind and the end user a peace of mind\nwith better ideas of deployment so that\nyou don't really have to run around on\n10 different desks confirming if your\nchanges are actually deployed or not so\nthat's everything from me if you have\nany questions feel free to get in touch\nwith Ed Eureka I'm pretty sure you'll\nfind the contact details somewhere\naround this video and thank you very\nmuch for your time\nyou all have a good day and good luck\nI hope you have enjoyed listening to\nthis video please be kind enough to like\nit and you can comment any of your\ndoubts and queries and we will reply\nthem at the earliest do look out for\nmore videos in our playlist and\nsubscribe to any Rekha channel to learn\nmore happy learning", "response": "[Music]\nhello everyone my name is Michaan's\nand I'm gonna be your instructor for the\nday now the main topic of the day is to\nunderstand what do you mean by agile\ndevelopment and how can it actually help\ndifferent organizations to have better\napproach to deploying the application\nthat they have I've been working as a\nDevOps engineer with multiple\ndevelopment teams for the past 10 years\nthis session is being conducted on\nbehalf of Eddie Rekha\nnow the agenda for the day is a few very\nsimple questions that you would need\nanswered in order to actually make sense\nof what do people mean when they say\nthat you're HR so why do we need a job\nwhat is even ajar development the key\nterms of agile the advantages over\nciaochao and how do you implement agile\nin your organization or the team that\nyou're working with and the various\nmethods philosophies and the frameworks\nthat are available to actually implement\na job in the team that you have so back\nin the day there was something called as\nwaterfall development or the waterfall\nmodel of development so when I say\nwaterfall you can think about something\nlike you know a banking application or\ninsurance application or some Police\nDepartment application so the moment I\nsay waterfall model you can think of\nlike a really huge application which is\nyou know made up of small chunks of code\nfor example this application might have\na front-end this application would\nobviously have a back-end and then it\nhas some DNS routes and a few services\nthat it's dependent on so it doesn't\nreally matter how many services are part\nof this application but this entire\napplication was shipped as a one-hole\napplication that's how they used to\nhappen back in the day and this was\nreferred to or this method of\ndevelopment the waterfall method the\napplication was referred to as a\nmonolithic application now it's called\nmonolithic if I can write it properly\nmonolithic application now you know\neverything was fine in D&D unless like\ntwo thousands\n2002 and that's when things started to\nbecome a bit extreme because the clients\nwould have ten different requirements\nthat would change almost every day now\nif you have one single application you\nhave a single point of failure so if we\nwere changing even this limb part of\nthis application and if this part was to\nfail this entire application would stop\nworking that's when people started\nbrainstorming about better approaches to\nsoftware development and how can you\nmeet the requirements of the millennium\nof the today's world - without actually\naffecting how the software is written or\nany application is written in the first\nplace that's where the ideas of agile\ndevelopment came into the picture so\nthat was one part of the problem the\nsecond part of the problem was because\nit was a monolithic application the time\nthat it required to actually push the\nchanges for example let's say you have\nan application up and running in your\nproduction environment and your\ndevelopment team actually created a new\nfeature or they modify the existing\nfeature now that feature is supposed to\ngo in production right but it actually\nused to take days and months back in the\nday because you would never really know\nwhat's going to happen if you put it to\nproduction today there are so many\nmoving parts that you never sure if it's\ngoing to break the existing application\nthat you have so people used to actually\nshould do the maintenance I'm pretty\nsure you would have received those\nemails right like B will be unavailable\nduring this weekend because there is a\nscheduled downtime now that's what used\nto happen now that cannot really fly\nanymore right think about companies like\nNetflix uber Amazon they can't really be\ndown even for a moment because you never\nreally know how many people are\naccessing the service now that is the\nsecond part of the problem that people\nwere trying to solve\nthat's when agile came into the picture\nnow agile put in simple terms is a\nphilosophy to rapidly deploy an\napplication in much more organized way\nnow obviously there is a lot more\ndetails than meets the eye but in a\nsimple sentence that's what you mean by\na jar you want rapid deployment of the\nsoftware or the code that you\nwriting without having to wait for a\nlonger time at the same time you want to\nmake sure that you have small chunks of\ncode that can be shipped to the client\nor whichever application you're working\nwith that's the reason Rajal exists\ntoday and now we're going to look at\nwhat do you mean by agile and how can\nyou actually implement this so I hope we\nare pretty clear about why was there a\nrequirement of agile to begin with this\nis what you mean by waterfall model now\nthis is the traditional software\nbuilding practice right so you would\ngather the requirements you would design\nor architect how you imagined your\nsoftware to be and then there would be\nactually coding that would be executed\nthere would be verification and there\nwould be maintenance post deployment so\nthis is what has been happening for the\npast four decades but this won't really\nfly in today's world because there are\nmultiple changes being pushed every\nsingle day so you can't really just go\nthrough the months of planning for a\nlittle change so the way applications\nare developed have changed and so is the\nway applications are deployed so that's\nwhat you mean by waterfall models now I\nthink I have explained it pretty well\nthere are a lot of companies that still\nfollow this model but at the end of the\nday all of them are trying to you know\nmigrate to a more agile development it's\nnot so easy depending on the size of the\ncompany but you will still see a few\ncompanies using waterfall and they are\nin process of moving away from this\nmodel then comes our child to rescue so\nwhat is agile we've talked about the\nrequirement or void as agile even exist\nso far now let's look at what do you\nmean by a chef so agile is nothing but a\nchain of rapid development and\ndeployment meaning the first section of\nyour software development is always the\nplanning part but now you obviously know\nwhat you're about to build but you kind\nof break that entire application down\ninto small chunks of code and then you\nwork on those small services one service\nat a time ensuring that first of all you\nkind of follow the micro services model\nand at the same time you don't really\naffect the entire application in general\nso you plan you\ndesign you architect and you actually\ndevelop the application you test you\ndeploy it and you review it if you\nnotice launch is actually outside of\nthis entire circle meaning every time\nyou make a change it could be something\nas simple as just one line of code\nchange just available being renamed so\nit doesn't matter how small or how big\nthe changes the idea is the moment the\nchange is made it has to be deployed\neven in a dev environment so that you\ncan get a constant feedback over what's\nhappening with the code that you have\nimagine if you actually had to wait for\none month or two weeks just to get the\nfeedback on if you really want that\nchange or not now that could be a little\nannoying or frustrating from the\ndevelopers point of view so that's the\nfirst aspect of agile you plan you\ndesign you develop you test you deploy\nthe changes and then you review the\nchanges before you actually launch them\ninto production the other major aspect\nof agile is now instead of working with\nlike a huge chunk of application you\nwork in iterations so when I say\niterations what I mean is you have a\nspecific set of tasks that have to be\ncompleted in specific priority so that\nyou already know what you're supposed to\nbe working on and you are not really\nworried about ten different micro\nservices at the same time you have a\nspecific requirement where you should be\nfocused so you have the first iteration\nwhich might be the first part of your\napplication\nsecond iteration third iteration so\nthink about it this way if you have\nAmazon or any if you're working for you\nknow amazon.com or Amazon tour in which\nis the shopping website you might visit\namazon.com and you might think yeah it's\na one website it's not really one\nwebsite it's a website that's broken\ndown into several other services for\nexample the website itself might be\ncalled a front-end now the moment you\nreach to amazon.com you can click on a\nproduct right and then you can view the\ndetails of a product so that service\nit's not really a part of the front-end\nanymore that is being called from\nsomething else called as catalog now\nonce you decide that this is a\nproduct that I want to buy you click on\nbuy now and then it's going to take you\nto something called a shopping cart and\nafter you made the payments and all\nthose things you have email\nnotifications and you know text\nnotifications the point here is even\nthough all of these things are working\nin synergy they are actually completely\nseparate services completely separate\ntasks in the underlying architecture so\nif I am working on something on the\nfront end I don't really have to be\nworried about the catalogs and the\nshopping because first I am getting a\nconstant feedback even before the launch\nI am getting a feedback about what's\ngonna happen once we launch your code to\nthe production at the same time I don't\nreally have to be afraid that it's gonna\nbreak my entire application because all\nof them are developed as separate\nmicro-services your one service will\nnever affect another service of course\nthe dependent services might be affected\nbut the idea is you never really want a\nsingle point of failure that's the idea\nof a jar now let's move forward now what\nare the terms and the values of our job\nso the first value is people over\nprocesses and tools working software\nover comprehensive documentation\ncustomer collaboration over rigid\ncontracts and responding to change\nrather than following a plan so people\nover process and tools this kind of who\ngives you you know a development centric\nand client centric environment meaning\njust because you've been doing something\nin a traditional way for the past eight\nyears it does not mean you don't really\nexplore the options that you have right\nnow for example whatever you did with\nPHP my sequel yesterday can also be done\nwith Python and flask today right I'm\nnot saying change your entire\napplication what I'm saying is the model\nis pretty much people centric the people\nlike the development team and the\ncustomers and the end users are given\nmore importance and working software\nover comprehensive documentation now\nthis is something that all of us would\nhave noticed at some point in time right\nso every application would have an\ninternal document of how long 100 pages\n150 pages about all the class\nall the methods how the application is\nbeing built then why the application is\nbeing built who's the owner in like\nplethora of other details that you as an\nindividual is not even concerned about\nyou are concerned about what you have to\nbuild and how far along are you in that\ndevelopment task so in agile the\nfunctional application is given much\nmore importance than the documentation\nbecause if you think about it the code\nitself is a documentation right if you\nknew how to interpret the code you could\nlook at the code and that can also act\nas an documentation so I'm not saying\nthat won't be any documentation all I'm\nsaying is the development is given more\nimportance over the documentation part\nand then customer collaboration over\nrigid contracts and responding to change\nrather than following the plan so agile\nis really feedback dependent meaning\nback in the day you know the managers\nand the product owners will have\nmultiple meetings they'll come up with\nthe kind of software that they bought\neverything would be discussed over like\nthree four months and then people would\nwant to stick to the plan because you\nalready spent four months planning this\nthing now if you wanted to change even a\nlittle part of this the entire meetings\nand planning would have to be done all\nover again\nnow agile changes that agile works more\non the feedback just because the plan\nhas been made it does not mean that\ncannot be any changes because you've\nbroken things down into smaller chunk of\ntasks any one of the tasks can be\nmodified according to the requirements\nat any point in time so these are the\nvalues that agile bring to the table\nright so there are two parts of the\npuzzle you have a benefit in the new\ntable of value so benefit is what you\nget like right off the bat and value is\nwhat you derive out of it so what we saw\nbefore were the values where everyone\nyou know on the table receives some of\nthe other kind of benefit because of our\njob principles of agile satisfied\ncustomer welcomed changing requirements\ndeliver working software frequently\nfrequent iterations with stakeholders\nmotivated individuals face-to-face\ncommunications measured by working\nsoftware main\nin constant pace sustained technical\nexcellence in good design keep it simple\nempower self-organizing team reflect and\nit just continuously now this might look\nmore like a textbook think like here are\nthe 10 benefits you know just go with a\njob but that's not really the case we\nare actually going to look at how all of\nthis materializes like you know over the\nfuture slides when we actually talk\nabout how can you implement a job in the\nworking or the team that you're working\nwith\nso let's more now advantages of agile do\nyou pretty much kind of you know touched\nupon all of these things for now\npersistence software delivery increased\nstakeholder satisfaction inspect and\nadapt\nwelcome to changes at any stage design\nis important and daily interactions\nnow comes the meat of the entire\npresentation now you have a basic idea\nof Persia right but question that\neverybody has at any point in time is\nwhat's in it for me okay you told me\nwhat's a gel and how can I tell but how\ncan it help me as an individual or how\ncan I actually implement a job so there\nare multiple frameworks or philosophies\nwhen it comes to agile so scrum extreme\nprogramming lean Kanban crystal are some\nof the examples the most popular one out\nthere\nit's called scrum now again these\nphilosophies are not really set in stone\nit's not like if you following scrum\nthat you know it's 100% what scrum\ndictates you how to do it that way\nthat's not really the case in majority\nof the cases what people do is they\nprimarily implement scrum and then they\nhave some ideas from canva and extreme\nand lean and then they kind of have\ntheir own philosophy that works for\ntheir organization but scrum is the one\nthat's used by the majority of the\npeople so even before looking at the\nslide you know before we go through what\nwe see in the slide I can just kind of\nexplain scrumpy you the way I know it\nright because I worked with multiple\ndevelopment teams I've seen most of\nthese being implemented and I know how\neach one of them work in the real world\nexample so what is scrum so scrum is\nbasically an iterative philosophy\nmeaning\nyou I trade over the changes you I trade\nover the deployments and software\ndevelopment one at a time so if you\nwanted to talk about scrum scrum is an\niteration of plan then build\nthen Cass\nand then review\nnow you would constantly be iterating\nover all of these aspects now what do I\neven mean by this so let's first look at\nhow or what does a scrum implemented\nteam looks like so in scrum implemented\nteam you have the very first person that\nI want to talk about someone corners\nproduct owner\nnow when I say product owner if you're\ncoming from you know more of a\ntraditional software development\nenvironment you can think of a product\nowner as a manager he is the guy who\nholds the responsibility to make sure\nthat the application is deployed as and\nwhen committed at the same time the\napplication is built exactly as the way\nit has to be built so product owner is\nthe guy with the ideas he might not\nnecessarily be a technical person he\nmight as well be a guy from the\nmanagement he does not necessarily have\nto know the development or the\ntechnicalities in detail he's the guy\nwith the idea and the owner of the\napplication that would be developed so\npretty much all the accountability lies\non him and then there is someone called\na scrum master\nnow scrum master is someone that you\nwould have traditionally referred to as\na team leader or a project owner now you\ncan think about scrum master as a team\nleader in the hierarchical sense this is\nthe person that's right below the\nproduct owner and this is the person who\nactually does the data or handles the\nday-to-day operations like you know\nrunning the meetings or handing the\ntasks that have to be done and then you\nhave the team itself which will consist\nof your developers and testers and you\nknow depending on your requirement it\nmight have a few more roles but then you\nhave the actual team but we'll execute\nthe tasks so these are the three roles\nthat you have but now that we know the\npeople that are involved how exactly\nthis works I mean this looks pretty much\nsimilar to what you do at your office\nit's just fancy names right you have a\nmanager you have a team leader and you\nhave a team so how is it any different\nfrom what you do at your office so\nthat's what we want to look at now I\nhope the roles are kind of clear to you\nnow that you have the roles defined\nlet's look at the first thing about the\ndevelopment so the first part of the\ndevelopment that we want to look at it's\ncalled product\nbacklogs\nnow here's where things start to get a\nbit different from how you might have\nbeen working at a traditional\nenvironment now in a traditional\nenvironment you have an application that\nhas been already planned for months and\nyou along with others have been working\non deploying the application and you\nknow the project usually goes on for a\nfew months or even a year or two\ndepending on the size of the project now\nin product backlogs you actually have\nthe same application iterated over in\nsmaller tasks so when I say smaller\ntasks you can think about the same\namazon.com about so the first iteration\nwill have plan it will have build it\nwill have test and it will have review\nnow in this case I'm not really building\nthe whole application I obviously have\nan idea as to what the application is\nsupposed to look like but for now let's\nsay I'm only concerned about the\nfront-end or what the main or the\nprimary website would look like then I\nhave a second iteration where I would\nyou know the same cycle plan build test\nand review but this is where I'm\nactually working with email notification\nI'm actually coding how would my email\nnotifications be sent out and you know\nhow do you manage the email queues and\nthe rest of the things and then you have\na third iteration which might just be\nyour payment processing so in this case\nagain the same cycle you plan you build\nyou test and you review but the benefit\nhere is that once you have the product\nbacklog these are all your product\nbacklogs these are the things that are\nsupposed to be done over a period of\ntime so the first thing you do is you\ndefine the product backlogs not you as a\ndeveloper but the product owner and the\nscrum master these are the people that\nwill actually come up with all the\nbacklogs instead of you know just one\nsingle application that says I want this\nthing to work they actually break it\ndown into small chunks of code so that\nis the job of the product owner and the\nscrum master because as I said product\nowner might not be a technical guy\nnecessarily so scrum master is the one\nthat would all\nyour technical right right so both of\nthem would come up with a product pad\nRox\nonce you have a product backlog there is\nsomething called as user stories so each\none of these would now be referred to as\nuser stories and your scrum master\nactually ends up prioritizing them\nmeaning if you have front-end email\npayment processor and ten other backlogs\nthat have to be developed let's say over\nnext five or seven months in that case\nthe scrum master and the product owner\nwould kind of prioritize now obviously\npayment processor is of no use if you\ndon't even have a project so logically I\nwould want to prioritize my front-end\nover my payment processor so scrum\nmaster and product owner will prioritize\nthe user stories that you have and\ndepending on the priorities that has\nbeen said they come up with something\ncalled a sprint backlog\nnow spread backlog is when your\ndevelopment team actually gets involved\nin this because now you already have an\norganized and prioritized user stories\nthat you are supposed to be working on\nso ten different things are not just\ndumped on you at the same time you are\ngiven a logical and reasonable tasks\nthat have to be executed one at a time\nand once he has a sprint backlog you can\nactually start working on it as a\ndevelopment now I'll get rid of this\nbeautiful drawing that are made for now\nthen let's just look at now a sprint\nbacklog\nI'm sorry I can't really you know write\nwith my mouse but I hope you realize\nit's called sprint now there are\ndifferent you could call them ceremonies\nor rituals but there is something called\na sprint planning\nnow the sprint planning again it's just\na fancy name for the makings and\ndiscussions that you have during the\nsprint planning the product owner will\nactually explain how he imagines the end\ngoal or the product for the application\nto look like so you have something\ncalled a sprint planning you have\nsomething called its daily scrum now\ndaily scrum is nothing more than you\nknow the 15 minutes meeting that happens\nevery day where the developers and the\ntesters and any other role that you have\nin the game can actually discuss what\nhappened and where you stand if you need\nany help there any blockades and what do\nyou plan to do today or tomorrow and\nthen there is something called a sprint\nreview so sprint review actually occurs\nat the end of the user story or the\nbattle that you've been working on so\neach and every one of these user stories\nright they usually are designed with the\ntimeline of two weeks in mind now some\ncompanies the Sprint's may vary like it\ncould be two weeks to four weeks but in\nmajority of the cases each sprint will\nlast two weeks so that you know exactly\nwhat you're supposed to do for the next\ntwo weeks now at the end of the two\nweeks along with you know you're\nplanning your daily meetings once your\nsprint is completed you have a sprint\nreview but you actually demo of the code\nthat you have or you know there's some\nkind of verification to make sure that\nSprint is actually completed and then\nyou move on to a new sprint or you move\non to a new user story that you have to\nwork on so that's the idea that's how\nthings work in general now with that in\nmind if we move on to the next slide\nthis is what the scrum looks like so you\nhave a product backlog and then you have\na sprint planning now as I mentioned\nbefore each one of these Sprint's the\ntimeline is usually a couple of weeks\ndepending on the size of your\norganization it might last up to a month\nbut for all the companies are outward\nwith it's always been between 1 to 3\nweeks so you plan for what has to be\ndone during the next two weeks and then\nyou have the user story or the backlog\nthat you're supposed to work on and then\nyou have your team that actually works\non it along with the daily scrum\nso you have the daily meetings at the\nsame time and at the end of the sprint\nyou have the review and then you ship\nthe part that you code it now when I say\nyou ship the part I don't mean you\nnecessarily put it in production but you\nknow that the part is ready to be\nassembled into the application that you\nhave so the idea is at the end of every\ntwo weeks you have a shippable part of\nthe application that is ready to be\ndeployed so instead of working a huge\napplication that would have taken a year\nanyway now you kind of break it down\ninto things that can be actually shipped\nin two weeks depending on the priorities\nthat have been set by the product owner\nand the scrum master that you have\nthat's the idea of scrum to break\neverything down into smaller chunks of\ncoal smaller chunks of tasks so that\neveryone knows exactly what they're\nsupposed to do that's like the\nmethodical part of it right you have a\nmethod there is a specific best set of\npractices that you following along with\nthe technical side because you have a\nrapid deployment the moment you write a\ncode you can actually test it in the dev\nenvironment now that's where people like\nme\nDevOps come into the picture but the\nidea is you don't really have to wait\nfor a month just to see what you code it\nright now if you push the code right now\nin matter of minutes you would actually\nsee that working in the dev environment\nso that's the technical side you have\nthe instant feedback to figure out if\nyou have to move on or you know if you\nhave to make some changes to the code\nthat you have right now now that's crumb\nand agile in general then there is a\nsecond method so scrum was one of the\nphilosophies or framework then you have\nsomething called as extreme programming\nnow this was one of the first ones a\ngroup of developers came up with it back\nin 2001 I think the guy was called Kent\nso they kind of came up with the idea of\nagile development they came up with a\nset of best practices and then they even\nsigned a manifest so they actually came\nup with a manifest that you know these\nare the things that we should be\nfollowing in the industry these are the\nbest practices and these are the\nprinciples and they even signed it so\nextreme programming has been around for\nalmost a couple of decades and scrum is\nkind of the next iteration of extreme\nprogramming it's a big different but as\nI said before majority of the\norganizations using scrum programming so\nin extreme programming they came up with\nyou know the basic sets of principles\nlike people centric environment\ndiscipline and then you have rapid\ndeployment so project requirements\nstories test cases task completion\ncustomer input iteration planning now\nboth of these things are happening in\nparallel so you have project\nrequirements you have stories test cases\ntasks and completion and at the same\ntime you have customer input and at some\npoint you have customer relations in the\nmeeting for example you developed 20% of\nthe application and your end user or\nyour client came back with a better idea\nor if they need some modifications so\nthose are the changes then you have your\nUNT testing you have client side duty\ntesting and acceptance at the end of it\nso extreme programming the ideas are\nsomewhat similar to scrum but at the end\nof the day all of these philosophies are\ntrying to make the lives of developers\nthe end users better and not\ncompromising on technicalities rather\nmaking the shippable product better and\nfaster is the idea all right let's move\non then you have lean programming so\nlean principles even this has been\naround for a while so eliminate waste\namplify learning decide as late as\npossible decide as fast as possible\nempower the team build integrity and see\nthe whole yeah so you could call it a\nframework you could call it a philosophy\nor methodology now it really depends on\nyou know the word that you want to use\nbut at the end of the day it's again\ntrying to become a developer centric and\npeople centric and setting best\npractices to make sure everyone in the\nteam knows exactly what they're supposed\nto do and you have a cross-functional\nteam when I say cross-functional\nessentially I'm pretty sure if you're\nwatching this video is because you have\nsome of the other development experience\nand if you do then you would have come\nacross this point right when you talk to\nsomeone okay\nyou've seen that feature and we looked\nat the code and that guy would be like\nyou know that code doesn't concern me\nit's none of my concern\nI'm working on something completely\ndifferent you know we are used to that\nsort of development right where people\nindividually know what they're supposed\nto do and they're not even worried about\nwhat the other person is doing now it's\ntime we actually break the silos just\nbecause you're not coding that part it\ndoes not mean that the code does not\nconcern the part of the code that you\nare writing so everybody has to come\ntogether and work on the same\napplication which is what you'll call a\ncross-functional team in the scrum\nexample once you have the user stories\nand the backlogs that you are supposed\nto work on in the next two weeks it\ndoesn't really matter what role do you\nplay in the team it's your team's\nresponsibility to make sure that the\ntask has been completed and the task is\nalso being designed with the timeline in\nmind so it's not like you're expected to\ndo a six weeks worth of development in\ntwo weeks so the task itself is designed\nwith the timeline in mind and then you\nhave something like Kanban so Kanban is\nsimilar to scrum the difference here is\nin case of scrums you have you know\nsmaller chunks of backlogs that you're\nsupposed to work on for the next two\nweeks or three weeks in case of Kanban\nit's a continuous process so there is no\nsuch thing as sprint in can be what you\ndo in Kanban is you have a list of tasks\nthat are supposed to be done and for\nexample you have something like you know\na whiteboard\nyou have a build queue you have a test\nqueue and you have a ship queue now this\nis a hypothetical example you would\nobviously have plan and the rest of the\nX but the point is you might have four\nthings that have to be built or let's\njust say three services that have to be\nbuilt and once the first service has\nbeen built it actually moves on to the\ntesting you and then this place is\noccupied by another service and once\nthis is done this is moved on to testing\nand this is occupied by another service\nmeanwhile if this testing is done it\nwill move to the ship queue and it will\neventually be shipped so the idea is\nwhatever tasks have been achieved will\nbe the placed by a new item in the queue\nso if you have a build Q test queue and\nship you all of these would be moving\nparts so if your job is to build this\nand let's say your colleague drove this\nprotest this the moment you push this\nfirst item into the testing you another\nitem will replace this first item so\nthat you know what is the next thing\nthat you are supposed to be working on\nso Kanban is more like a continuous\nimplementation of the software\ndevelopment so that's what you mean by\nagility in general even if you think\nabout it\nthe English word agility means to be\nreally rapid right agility would mean\nwhatever you're doing is happening in\nrapid succession\nright that's what you mean by agility in\ngeneral so in case of development by\nbringing agility to your team you are\nensuring that everyone's happy at the\nend of the day and you still have a\ntechnically smarter team that's able to\nget instant feedback now I'll give you a\nquick example of this now I'm pretty\nsure all of us or at least most of us\nare aware about Netflix now you would be\nsurprised to know that Netflix is\npushing more than 1,000 changes every\nday into their productions if you\nactually worked at a Netflix development\nteam you would know that these guys are\npushing a thousand changes in production\nevery day now how do you think that's\npossible obviously they are not pushing\nit to production without reviewing it so\nwithout testing it even with all of\nthose things in place how are they able\nto deploy more than 1,000 changes every\nday now these could be very little\nchanges like you know some UI fixes some\ndatabase fixes some payment process and\nfixes so we are not really concerned\nabout what the changes are but I know\nfor a fact that that's the number that's\nthe amount of changes that they actually\npush every day that's possible because\nyou mean the rapid deployment by agility\nor by becoming a jar so that's the level\nof agility you can actually obtain the\nmoment you have an organized team that\nis working on the principles of a jar\nnow obviously there are external factors\nlike you know how's your infrastructure\nhow's your time off stream but it is\npossible at the end of the day and then\nthere is one more framework that's\ncalled Crystal so these are the ideas of\na job now I hope I was cleared into how\ncan i shall help your team in becoming a\nbetter development team so there are\nthree aspects of it right philosophical\ntechnical and the way software is built\nso philosophical being the best\npractices like how do you define your\nteam's who is a scrum master who's a\nproduct owner what's the team what is a\nsprint what are the tasks that you're\nsupposed to do then you have the\ntechnical side of it like if you build a\ncode how exactly can you deploy the code\nlike automatically how can you review\nthe code how can you test the code\nautomatically and then there is a\nsoftware development aspect of it that\nyou are moving away from a monolithic\napplication towards the idea of micro\nservices so these are the three aspects\nthat move parallely and at the end of\nthe day it gives you a peace of mind it\ngives your product manager a peace of\nmind and the end user a peace of mind\nwith better ideas of deployment so that\nyou don't really have to run around on\n10 different desks confirming if your\nchanges are actually deployed or not so\nthat's everything from me if you have\nany questions feel free to get in touch\nwith Ed Eureka I'm pretty sure you'll\nfind the contact details somewhere\naround this video and thank you very\nmuch for your time\nyou all have a good day and good luck\nI hope you have enjoyed listening to\nthis video please be kind enough to like\nit and you
